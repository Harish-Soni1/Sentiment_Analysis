I was touched by the service of the extremely welcoming staff especially by Chef Gokul Menon, who went beyond his way to cater to my needs. He especially came to visit us when he found us to be a little confused and extended his hospitality. He made sure to prepare the most lip smacking food for us and what touched us more was the way the food was delivered. The unparalleled gesture by the young Chef, made the food taste a 1000 times more tasty than it was! Hats off to you, Chef! May you strive to be the best!

51,"is is our first time in ITC Rajputana and it will be the last. From the moment we stepped out from our car our experiences has been nothing but dissapointing.  Hallways were dirty and rooms were old and looked dinzy.  No sleepers in the rooms, 1 robe for 2 people.   We had to change our room once and the AC did not work. We found out it was turned off and after cooked in our room when we called the front desk, the technician showed up with ladder to manually turn the AC on. The guests have to ask the hotel to manually turn the AC on then you can control it.  Jaipur Pavilion restaurant is open 24/7, service is terrible.

When we went out for dinner at Peshawari Restauran each and every plate was sanitised and kept in a paper bag similarly with the cutlery as well.

Surprisingly it was cheaper than the Thalis of restaurants with Zomato rating 3.0 like Virasat etc. She also arranged for a anniversary cake and flower's which was a nice gesture.

Very caring and not a single request was unmet. Really impressed by the service. The food was also wonderful, especially the extensive buffet breakfast. Was a tad disappointed by the Peshawari food. The seekh kababs were overspiced. Perhaps contemporary taste buds dictate cooking styles over time.  A lovely, relaxing experience with two small children who enjoyed themselves a lot.

The lobby is one if the most beautiful we have ever seen, very tastefully built with marble. The checking process was run of the mill but smooth enough. Room is spacious with all the amenities week thought of. We noticed that money was spent on what is useful and saved on things that are frivolous. The hotel put a lot of emphasis on eco friendliness. They minimized plastic/single use items such as tooth brushes/comb limiting them to “please ask if you need”.  Overall, we have become loyal customers for ITC brand.

372,"e hotel caters for large tour groups and, while we were there, wedding parties. That means a lot of traffic and noise for early starts and late nights. If you’re an independent traveller, you will feel squeezed out. Combination of marble floors, thin walls and heavy crashing doors meant there was no quiet time during our 3 days. We moved rooms once (managed very efficiently by Suriya at reception, thank you!) but ended up in the middle of a group of rooms rented by the wedding party. Cue 18 hours of non stop noise. Other than that, there’s not much ‘luxury’. Very comfy beds, generally great staff but dated bathrooms and decor.

I liked the pool, was very inviting but didn't get the opportunity to swim. The front desk manager I think his name is Harsh was very courteous and helpful. I was lucky to get a late check out. The lady Chef Parul was seen interacting with guests and was helpful to offer me their local speciality. Guys you must not miss Peshawri restaurant - similar to Delhi Bukhara.

They did everything they could to make sure, my daughter didnt feel homesick.   I applaud the team and I especially would like to thank the Exec Chef Paro, who though soooo very busy, took the time to ask us how we were, making special meals to help my daughter assimilate to the Indian spices.

The staff at every level seemed more interested in catering to the foreigners present -whether this was at the lounge or being frankly rude when we had to call multiple times to request our laundry be delivered (staff arguing with us after having delivered it to the wrong room). We spoke with the Manager on multiple occasions-to no avail. The service remained sub-standard.  The room itself was, as expected, gorgeous. We ate dinner at Peshawri our first night there and developed horrible food poisoning.  The car service (Sharmaji) was excellent -both for our local sightseeing as well as drive back to Delhi.

793,"rrible experience at this hotel. Had booked for 3 nights and almost regretted the decision the moment I saw the filth outside the hotel. It is situated in a very dirty area with logged water and garbage around it. I requested for an upgrade at check-in stating my Marriott Platinum Elite status and the check-in lady told me- ""they dont care about Marriott status, only ITC.""  Because of this bad experience, when I wanted to checkout sooner after 1 night, the hotel insisted that I pay the entire 3-night amount, which is ridiculous. They're forcing you to stay at their hotel, as they very well know how bad the property is. I called the duty manager and told him that I am a Marriott Platinum mamber and it is a corporate booking. His response was - ""I don't care, you have to pay…",1, a review Aug 2019

It is not hotels fault but it was hard to get a good night sleep with at least 6 processions from 3:30am till 6am. ",5,te a review Jul 2019

Proximity to city centre is another advantage. Staff are courteous to accept extended check-out till 2:00 PM. Thanks to Mr.M.K.Joy of sales Dept for prompt response to our querries .

However as I was reviewing my credit card statement, I noticed they charged me in USD instead of local currency, a difference of over 5%.  Better training of the staff would ensure that the check out personnel ask the guest which currency rather than putting the slip in an envelope and waiting for the guest to pick up the mistake only if they review their credit card statement.

The other slightly subpar experience is that their evening buffet is extremely pricey for the quality that you get.  I'd recommend not doing the buffet, if one can help it, and just dining out or going to another restaurant in the neighborhood.  Each adult was about $45 per person and I would not repeat that experience.  Other than that, great hotel & hospitality!",4,a review Apr 2019

Jaipur has ridiculous traffic so you will need a driver and the hotel has a travel desk to help you with that. Be prepared to pay but what can you do? We felt the place was a little out of the way so we had our meals in the restaurants and they were good. We avoided Peshwari because we hated the same one in Agra.",4,te a review Jan 2019

So I booked this hotel as one of our accommodation.. And We love it too max... From the moment we arrive and depart... It was a very royal and pleasant stay.. We had dinner in one of their inhouse restaurants and I couldn't recall the name but the restaurant near to the lobby.. Their lal mans(local dish lamb).. Is the best.. Even my chinise and malay friend love it and even after come back their talk about the food... Ans their breakfast choice is super good and restaurant staff was doing a great job.. The only shortfall was the receptionist.. They was not really helpful and consistent... Of they improve on that…,4,wrote a review Dec 2018

There are aspects of the hotel that can be improved and perhaps not worth the price tag.   Stayed here for 6 nights last week. The property is not ideally located. It is in the old part of the city right next to the railways station. The property itself is great but the rooms are tiny and bathroom even more so for such a high-end hotel. Moreover, any sound from the rooms in the upper floor was very audible causing some disturbance.  The larger issue I have with this property is that the front desk and the staff are biased towards foreigners. I've seen a little bit of this happening in other ITC properties as well. I hope ITC takes cognizance of this…",5,a review Nov 2018

It also included lounge facilities including evening cocktails and hors d'ouevres. On check-in at the hotel when we enquired about our inclusions we were told that hotel doesn't have any club lounge!

I used their spa and salon services and both were excellent. The reason I didn’t give 5 stars are due to two things. Firstly, the hotel doesn’t offer everyone the same warm welcome. You will only be greeted with a flower garland and a welcome drink, if you’re a foreigner and you’re white. I was a foreigner too but with brown skin, so the welcome wasn’t quite the same.

The lobby has the grand staircase which is a signature of ITC hotels although not as grand as the iconic staircase at the ITC Chola. The interior truly reflects the architecture and glorious history of Jaipur with superb port artists of Jaipur's Magnificent Royalty.  Guests are greeted in true Rajasthani style with a tikka on the forehead and the sounding of the traditional horn to announce the arrival of the hotel's respected guest.

We were given a welcome drink and greeted by very welcoming members of staff. Our check in was very efficient and we settled into our room. The room was very clean, bed very comfortable and bathroom immaculate. We stayed at 3 different 5* hotels over the course of the week and this one had my favourite pool area by far. It was fairly big so plenty of space to swim and there were some lovely sun loungers/beds/seats around the pool offering plenty of places for people to relax.

1593," stay here is coming to an end and do not feel like going back. Reasons for me loving this place are numerous. However let me share a few here. All hotels are made of brick and mortar but they are actually made worth their while due to the women and men serving and managing them. ITC Rajputana is a superlative example of this. People i have immense pleasure mentioning are Dhruv, a young smart, energetic guy who tirelessly makes sure that we are happy and comfy. He is GM in the making.  Mahipal the sweet and diligent boy who is oh so helping and polite. He knows the city very well and helped us plan our itenary. The Chef Navneet for making sure that my 5 year old boy doesn't starve due to his unique food habits. The kitchen staff is not only competent but also very informed,…",5,a review Jun 2018

I must say that the kind of hospitality the hotel offers is exquisite and I have always checked out with thought of coming back soon.

They even gave a complimentary cake to celebrate our anniversary, which was a nice touch. The reason for deducting 2 stars is that one expects top service with finesse from a top hotel.

Traditional old rooms with bland interiors and not really great as what is being offered by new chain of good star hotels.

Had a look at the bar/restaurant menu for dinner and the prices were slightly more expensive than a London restaurant!   The pool area was great and generally quite quiet due to the business nature of the hotel.

There are no proper footpaths and as soon as you leave the grounds the squalor is appalling. As in ITC Agra we received room upgrade as it was my husband's 60th birthday, but to be honest the room was the smallest on our travels.

Normally I wouldn't care but when traveling with kids, I could have really used the cartoon network.  Maybe I just got unlucky and I'm sure normally you will be fine.  The hotel seemed otherwise great.",4,view Nov 2017

An organisation that takes care of its employees has to excel come what may! I see familiar faces, faces sporting bigger smiles from the previous time, every time I visit. A few noteworthy names are those of Mr. Chandrabhan (Jaipur Pavilion), Mr. Dharam (Peshawri) and Mr. Kuldeep (Peshawri) who have been working here for over twenty years with the same impetus! Ms. Himangi at the welcome desk was very delightful too!  Everything was impeccable except for the bell staff who simply did not turn up to take my luggage when requested this time around.  Nevertheless, I thoroughly enjoyed this short jaunt of mine at the ITC…",4, wrote a review Sep 2017

But when we wanted the hotel could not serve a small portion as they wanted to sell whole glass  which is around 200 rs. I have to many hotels which do not even charge for toddlers. It is not about money one who can stay in ITC can easily afford it. But what the problem that kid wants it & then do not drink whole while he need small amount of it.

2350,"tting in a different more expensive hotel in a different city, I registered on TripAdvisor just to write this one review. Such has been the stay at ITC Rajputhana. For someone who generally has long business stays, ITC Rajputhana is a bliss. While every ITC hotel stands out in this, Rajputhana is particularly special. None of the top notch international chains can beat hospitality of the staff at this place. Finally, the best part about this place is the F&B section. They really really take care of you like you are a part of their Family. Even today I have not come across one single restaurant that can meet the service quality and friendly staff of Jai Mahal.

The hotel staff called us and asked if we would be interested in moving to another room. We said yes, and the staff said they will look at the availability and call us back in a few minutes. We were still waiting for them to call back when we were checking out. Also, they always seem to be short on towels. Housekeeping services were very poor, sometimes all towels taken and not replaced.

There was a 24X7 coffee shop/restaurant that served the dinner buffet which did not have a very good selection of buffet items. They were too repetitive, and the food display was just not enticing.

The ghazal singing sessions at the restaurant added to the Rajputana ambience though I am not a fan of Ghazal music but it blended with the ambience quite well.,4,05 wrote a review Jun 2017

From the fasla juice as welcome drink to the pillow menu to ensure the best sleep, its the small details which hit all the ticks for us. ITC is known for its food, each meal was a memorable one especially our meal at Peshawari. We stayed at the Rajputana Royale Room, which gave use access to the cocktail hours (buy one get one + snacks) at The Sheesh Mahal, which is by the pool and has a brilliant lounge like atmosphere. 2 hours in the spa getting a full body massage and a head treatment was just what we needed before we headed back to our grinding schedules.

Our room was fine but a long walk to reception/restaurant/pool, etc. The restaurant was completely overwhelmed by diners in the evening and we had a wait of at least 20 minutes on our first night there. This is unacceptable. The food was adequate and the drinks fairly expensive. There is a good pool with plenty of seating/lounging  facilities, but we were surprised to be charged double the price of beers in the bar inside the hotel!

The food is quite average in comparison with other 5 star hotels. I am gluten allergic and, though the staff was very attentive and helpful, the gluten free pizza and bread were horrible. When we asked for the take away breakfast for our early flight, I received extremely tasteless food that I couldn't eat at all.

They have a station where they can make you pancakes/waffles. A whole side room dedicated to different fresh juices (with lots of variety, including interesting choices like bitter gourd juice!) and another one for fruit.

It is part of the ITC group but run by Sheraton.  The lobby is very beautiful and vast.  Climb the staircase for photo op!  Service was wonderful.  Checking in was very fast and the front desk gal took us on a tour  en route to our rooms.  Rooms were fine - not large but adequate in size.  They gave plenty of free bottles of water in the room.  We were fortunate to stay in the wing that housed the breakfast restaurant as well as the hotel cafe, both on the first floor.  The hotel is spread out horizontally, although there are only 4 floors (but numbered 1100, 2100, 3100, 4100 for some strange reason).  So request the proper wing…",5, review Jan 2017

Meals were excellent - the drinks seemed over priced ($30 USD for gin and tonic and a glass of wine).

Avoid ground floor rooms facing the wall, it may get bit suffocating.

The bar was beautiful and rooms had with a good mix of traditional and modern feel.  2) Gym – I used the gym daily and found that they had good equipment, a really nice environment and friendly service.  The bad:  1) Overall attention to detail - I was ""upgraded"" to a Rajputana Haveli ""Suite"" (due to my SPG status) which was bigger than the traditional room I had booked.

After first night we asked for a change in room if possible and they gave us a higher floor similar room. This room felt a little bigger and had better lighting. The view was pool side which we didn't have any issue with. However having stayed at so many other luxury hotels our spirits were dampened by the smallness and feel of the room.

Rooms are tired and in need of renovation. Housekeeping is sloppy. Only one dressing gown and one pair of slippers in a double occupancy room; no bath towels after room is serviced; inadequate replenishment of tea and coffee provisions; bathroom and towels smell. Today a bell desk guy rang our room bell furiously at the crack of dawn and woke us up - then aploogised that he had the wrong room. And no hot water in our bathroom since last evening.

It's hard to decide which one is best but still I (being a meat lover) would go with Peshawari as their best restaurant. Rooms are fabulous. And yes, while you are there, don't forget to go for a great spa treat at their spa. ",5,e a review Nov 2016

Meals were taken in the “set aside for groups” restaurant and was buffet style. The selection was good and the quality of the food superb. Perhaps the live entertainment could be toned down a little. All meals were taken in this restaurant and the service was good. The pool is large and very clean, towels are supplied and there are plentiful sun beds. There can be a long walk from reception to some rooms as the building its built in a square, take a short cut…",5,wrote a review Oct 2016
3030,stayed here for two nights with our small group tour.  The hotel foyer is magnificent and the rooms also don't disappoint. I found the standard to be high and extremely comfortable.  Unfortunately the service side of the hotel let them down and from my experience it stems from management.  My first disappointment was when I ordered an espresso coffee at breakfast which took 50 minutes to deliver. I was initially told they were cleaning the machine. The staff kept me informed during my wait which I appreciated.  My major disappointment was the laundry I had done. I had my washing picked up at 7.40am. The laundry form states that the washing would be returned after 6 hours. Expectation is that it should have been returned some 6-7 hours. After 10 hours I had to enquire as to…,2, wrote a review Oct 2016

I would also like to extend my warm regards and thanks to Mr. Saurabh (duty manager), who went out of his way to accomodate me in one of the best suite ITC has (Rajputana suite).

I read on their site that if I booked directly through them I would be entitled to free internet (surprising as in this day and age internet is a given). So I tried doing that. However, their site would not accept any of the dates I was selecting for my travel. Every time I clicked on a date it would not populate the date field. No error message at all. After several attempts I gave up and booked my room through Makemytrip.   On arrival I explained the situation to Shiv at reception but he said he could not do anything and we would have to pay for the internet. He refused to budge. I asked to speak to the manager.

The problem is that the management plays games with the SPG program. For example, I am trying to redeem points for a night, but the hotel has taken their standard rooms (eligible for point redemption) and just added breakfast to them so that they are no longer eligible for points redemption. This is completely against SPG rules and is a waste of my time to try to figure out. Now I stay at other properties in Jaipur and encourage family / friends to do the same. This is unfortunate since it is a nice property, but this behavior by their management is unacceptable.",3,dia wrote a review Sep 2016

3429," you are traveling through India and find yourself in Jaipur, the Pink City, Rajasthan then I highly recommend you stay at least once in the ITC Rajputana hotel. From the moment you walk in to the reception your breath will be taken away by the magnificence of the lobby and grand staircase.

The reception team which is made up of the guys behind the desk and the girls who welcome you with the traditional Indian application of a bindi to your forehead.

Swimming pool: Its clean but not very big.   Games: they is a kids zone but it's not that good and well equipped. There is snakes and ladder too in pool premises.

It's also close to some really good restaurants in case you fancy heading out for a meal. The in house restaurants also serve some of the best North Indian food that I have ever tasted. The Lal mass is incredible. On a side note 'Peshawari' which is one of ITC's flag ship restaurants is one of the most expensive places to eat bar none probably in all of India. The property as such is very beautiful and maintained well. Staff is very courteous.  Did face an issue with some very loud people in the room next door who were very loud even past midnight. Highlighted this to reception and this was addressed immediately. I would recommend ITC Rajputana without any hesitation.,5,wrote a review May 2016

Here is a grand foyer, lovely royal restaurants, rooms with too many fancy gadgets but it lacked theONE thing that makes or breaks a service organization. It lacked caring service to the guest. Very often in many businesses, one makes a product that we THINK the customer wants, but too TOO often we forget that the business EXISTS  FOR THE CUSTOMER not independent of it. One cannot be SO arrogant as to INSIST on what the customer SHOULD want. So here is a 5 star property that failed to make the grade becuase it hadthingsthat i as a guest dont care about.And it could not come up to par in the things that I DO want. e.g. free wifi was nowhere on this property.

Breakfast selection and room service was also pretty good, but not really authentic. Asian Laksa and Hor Fun, were cooked with no resemblance to the actual dish but still tasted good as a stand alone and no reference to its names.  Rooms also a little tired and worn, some rooms are located too close to monorail, highways etc.   Exterior can be a little deceiving as it resembles more of a prison with high walls and barbed wires.

Once when we ordered a fruit platter in our room. And last when we were having our last lunch just before leaving.  The management seemed sorry but this is not acceptable.

The view from our room was probably the worst of any hotel I have ever stayed at: street, bridge over it and aerial metro over both. Inside, the room was comfortable with several nice features. The staff ranges from mediocre to nice and very attentive. Waiting and looking at tips is quite frequent at this property. The upper management is not as visible as in most Starwood hotels than I know. After an issue is reported the attention can be overbearing, not too authentic and even bothersome. This is a Luxury Collection property, but it is also a category 1. The F&B dept. might want to be stricter on the cleanliness and on the way the chefs are disposing of the food when they cook.

What was most impressive was the way they dealt with the shifting timelines and last minutes demands.   In fact, excellent service is the recurring theme, and it makes up for all the little niggles and glitches.

It took 2 calls and 35 mins to get one suitcase out of my room to the car and I had to keep waiting after check out. The buffet dinner again quite ordinary in options and in quality.

Very Royal lobby and clean hotel. The rooms are very spacious. We were traveling with a 1 year old and a 6 year old and my parents.

Unknown to us, when you book a suite, you get butler service. Our butler was very professional, as one would expect for an Indian hotel of this caliber. The staff too were very nice.   My only complaint is that one of the main restaurants, Peshawri, is overpriced for the quantity of food, which may have been okay had the food not been rather bland.  Also a word of caution: if you are a foreign national, be sure to bring your passport. They require a passport upon check-in as per Indian regulations.",4,a wrote a review Jul 2015

One suggestion to the hotel is to have the suites on a separate floor.  I am assuming when ITC charges 100% more than a normal room for a suite, they understand why pay these extra amounts – for peace and quiet, not battle field environment ! …",3,"ndon, UK wrote a review Jun 2015"

The hotel seems bit out of place in the locality and has a somewhat ODD or STRANGE entrance gate.

When i compared the pool of this hotel with jal mahal hotel there is a huge difference. I would say if you are really looking for some authentic rajasthani hospitality in rajasthani style opt opt of other 5 star hotels as this hotel is more of a business hotel and its marketing which shows this as inspired by rajputana is a hugely false one. ,3, S wrote a review May 2015
4132,ayed in this hotel for 3 nights as part of a tour with GRJ.  It is a big hotel with two restaurants and a beautiful central pool area with an outside bar/eating area and shops.  The staff were very pleasant and the rooms were very comfortable.  The only downside was that we were originally given a room which looked out on the overhead metro which is still being expanded.  We were looking out at a large concrete pillar and track.  We were moved to another room which overlooked the swimming pool which was a much better view.  We used to take a shortcut across the central swimming pool area on the way back to our room in the evening.  We could stand and watch the tiny bats flying down to sip from the pool.,5,ote a review May 2015

However, it looks the Hotel isn't investing in decor upgrades as it will lose it's charm due to the Jaipur Metro coming up right beside the property. The Metro ramp is a few yards away from the perimeter wall of the hotel. Also, I noted the neighbourhood was not that great and can only be called ""OK"".  However, the common areas are great. The pool well maintained and service prompt.  The lobby portraits deserve a special mention of complement  Overall good stay.",4,review May 2015

The service isn't quick, the hotel lacks on aspects like cleanliness, buffet breakfast, room decor which aren't of the standard of a five star place.It is comfortable and has a grand exterior but the ITC Mughal, Agra, was a far more superior and luxurious experience. .

4267,e ITC Rajputana in Jaipur is a great hotel that I have stayed at 6 times while on business and as a tourist. I would like to mention the following:  Value: The hotel offers exceptional value. The price of the rooms is incredibly reasonable for the sense of luxury that is offered.  Food: The food here is wonderful. The breakfast offered is exceptional with live music played while you eat. The Peshawri and Pavilion restaurants are also excellent. Peshawri is so good that even my local business colleagues like to go eat here.  Service: The service here is very good. I find the front desk and restaurant staff very friendly and helpful each time that I visit. Dharmesh and Kumar stand out to me for their top-notch service.

We wanted to have Lunch at Pool bar and Shafiq arranged everything so well and Service was also very quick. Although the Bar was bit busy. but he was very active and engaging himself with all the guest very nicely...  The Pool was Under Maintanance at that time and I Just love to Swim...

The area around the hotel is a bit run down...and it is rather unfortunate that a new flyover has come down right in front of what must have been a much grander entrance.

Cramped bathrooms, chipped paint, splinters coming out of doors, old furnishings, etc, etc. Below average products, too. Breakfast was decent and the fresh juice bar a nice touch. The food is an odd mix, though. It's as if they are trying to cater to western and east Asian tastes at the same time, while providing just a limited nod to local south Asian food.  The design of the place is a bit odd, sprawling across giant wings with a slightly confusing elevator system.

My family had planned for a Five Day stay and we walked out on Day THREE. One can not fault the staff for not being courteous - they would have the right amount of deference and respect but action never followed through - simple stuff like Drinking Water needed to be asked for at least twice for someone to bring it for you.

The dal makhani is their signature dish and there have been times when I go there just to have the dal. If going in a large group you must try the Paneer makhani with Naan Bukhara. The Firni is one of the best I have had. The naan bukhara is crispy and goes very well with everything. It alone can feed upto 10 people so you can imagine the size. You must also try the Pineapple raita. It is made with hung curd with fresh pineapple pieces. End your meal with the Kesar Phirni which is served in a 'sikora'.

There is wood and marble all around.  The lobby has this expansive feel with exquisite jali work. Very impressive indeed.

The room was huge, and very nicely decorated, marble floor was stunning. The food was very nice also and a wide variety available in the buffet restaurant.

Our hopes were high after visiting the luxurious Agra hotel, but although comfortable enough, its safe to say that the Jaipur equivalent is not quite at the same level as its Agra stablemate.  The rooms (and indeed the main courtyard of the building) are starting to look a little dated and run down. Due to the layout of the hotel, it is a lengthy walk to rooms located round the far side of the building. The lobbies are nice enough, but the carpets and walls have obviously seen better days, The same can be said for the rooms; the beds are not connected to the back head boards, so there is actually a gap between the bed (on wheels) and the back wall.…",4, review Feb 2014

4969," this trip, we decided to experience Rajasthan royal style and decided to stay at ITC Rajputana in the pink city of India. The best surprise for us was when the manager Bhanu was kind enough to upgrade us to the highest room category to get a lovely room with a pool view. This was the best thing we could have asked for. The dinner at the Indian restaurant Peshawri was an experience in itself. We loved the food and especially the service. We even ended up chatting with some fellow guests at the hotel and they all seemed to be loving Jaipur and reaffirmed our decision of choosing the hotel as a great place to stay for frequent travellers.

The grand reception, the rooms, the breakfast spread, service ...everything at its best. The breakfast spread was excellent...many many choices from south to north india, continental spread, fruits, juices too. We enjoyed every bit of our stay. But we didn't make use of the pool or the spa. You could spend a couple of days just exploring the hotel and enjoying its decor and the grandness of this place. Total value for money.

Don't miss the morning Yoga classes and an evening of lovely drinks at the pool side.

However, the servers are just bad. It takes a battle of wills to get coffee or drink orders fulfilled. And forget getting things charged to your room or a bill split.

The chef on duty came down to our table and asked if we liked the food and if he could do something to make us happy... Much appreciated!

After traveling to Agra in the morning we hopped a train to Jaipur. The ride was easy and we arrived into the Jaipur station in the early evening.  Tired from the long day we were happy the the ITC Jaipur was so close to the station.

The swimming pool area was lovely nd my husband, a keen swimmer, made the most of it. We ate in the hotel one night but were not too impressed...overpriced for what we got.

Our tour members complained to the Front Desk and was assured that something would be done -- but nothing was done with the result that our tour members never had a wink of sleep.

5388,"e Sheraton in Jaipur is a five-star hotel in every sense of those words.  The staff aims to please in a helpful but not over-bearing way. They try to anticipate what you might want from a fresh cup of coffee at breakfast to an extra bottle of water in your room on a hot day.  The hotel itself is not a particularly impressive building from the outside and is a bit like a maze on the inside.   The rooms are five star, but I have been in more impressive rooms in my travels.   Nevertheless, I got an extremely competitive rate on the hotel's website and the value-for-money was among the best on this five-week trip.

5391, first visit to the pink city. Expectations running high as this was the land of the maharajas...at the Rajputana it was nothing of that sort. Below are my observations....   1. Rooms are tired and overused. 2. Front desk staff make a very distasteful attempt to welcome you upon check-in.  3. Breakfast spread is bland. Chefs don't even know how to fry & serve eggs! 4. At an establishment of this kind I wasn't even able to get a decent  Cappacino. 5. Ther gym was outstanding I must give credit to that. 6. Drivers assigned by the travel desk were the only individuals at the hotel who made an effort to make my stay pleasing.  On the whole overpriced and not worth the experience! Choose another hotel! ,2,review Dec 2011
