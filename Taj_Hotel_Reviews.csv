2,cgganster,"We normally stay at the Taj Lands End due to its location in Bandra West. Previously we also tried the Fours Seasons & the Sofitel BKC, however with Mumbai's crazy traffic, we lose too much time in cars. So we make the Taj our Home whenever we are in Mumbai. This time two people clearly stood out, Merlin from Front Office as well as Taronish Karkaria, the Director of Rooms, who made our stay so much more enjoyable. Being a Taj Loyalty Member, we were granted an upgrade & early check in. Nice amenities, one of the renovated rooms, facing the Ocean & the personalization you would look for - including WhatsApp access to Taronish. On our second stay within a 2-week window, he arranged Covid-19 testing in the privacy of our Room, which was extremely convenient as we had our 3-months old Baby with us & didn't want to roam around Mumbai & the various Hospitals to get tested. In Room Dining (especially the Chinese & Indian) was incredible, very good quality, served with the highest hygiene standards. Great job Taj Lands End - we will be back in a few months & look forward to it. Thank you Taronish, Merlin & the entire Team.…",5,7 Dec

4,CAAshok71,The hotel is located at a very nice place and TAJ has a signature service standard which is very good. It is worth the money. I enjoyed the stay. They charged me for the extra water which was not fair but otherwise overall good experience and would recommend the hotel to all. ,3,6 Dec

9,Riyaz,"Stayed 17 nights at @TajLandsEnd in the middle of the Pandemic and let me tell you, the staff at Taj Lands End has done everything possible to ensure a luxurious stay for us.  The rooms are very spacious and the views are spectacular. Housekeeping takes special care and sanitizes the room every time. Minor adjustments to amenities in the room due to covid, but you can hardly notice it and is very thoughtful during these times to keep us safe.  Last minute wedding planning was a breeze with Krutika assisting us with all the arrangements for food, decorations and the suite. Special kudos again to Krutika for arranging a photoshoot for us within the hotel with special management permission as we did not want to leave the premises due to covid. Thank you to Francis and Salil for…",5,w Nov 2020
10,agrosan,"I will discuss, the pros and cons Pros   Beautiful location of the property    Luxurious room with beautiful view especially 2048.,and small pretty anniversary cake(cake size according to  your room category choice.)   Beautiful decor of hotel .  Three stars are only because of above three pros.  Cons  Pathetic food taste, being a five star food taste should be of same calibre.  But to my extreme disappointment,food was tasteless.  Margherita pizza was pathetic as starter, taste less with no flavour.  Idli hard and flavorless,same with chutney and sambhar.  Poor taste of panner sabzi and starter, only italian lasagne was bit better.  If you cant provide taste in limited menu(spread) all meals package then your five star tag doesnot justify.  Cake were more sour then sweet. Only…",3,Nov 2020

12,Renee,We did a Staycation at Taj lands ends and it was so relaxing and Amazing. The view of our room was out of this world.The staff was very helpful. Since it was Diwali we got a few Diwali sweets complimentary from the Hotel. The only sad part was we could dine at the Chambers since it was open to Taj members only.

17,Ashok,"Made a first time booking for my wife's birthday when one of my good friend recommended. And the service offered by the staff at this property including breakfast was one of the best experience I ever had in any star hotels in India. The chocolate cake was lipsmacking.   The room was beautiful, elegant, serene with a great ambience and the best part is the sea view and the sunset.   Location was great as it is in Bandra, lot of good food places, shopping, a dog park, a park and basically you can go for a quick stroll around without being bored. Also, Bandra Bandstand is right next door and a must visit.   The service and hospitality by Taj was outstanding and excellent. Staff were very helpful and approachable. Thank you very much team for the wonderful Tajness :). ",5,Nov 2020

24,Ramesh,"Was there with family pre-COVID. Good amenities but very procedural and time wasting. Also the staff cannot take any decision easily and give straight answers. Breakfast is good and varied, as in the reviews. Other services are average. The security features for clients are cumbersome and unfortunately easily bypassed. Mind; late night transport to and from there is expensive and travel time quite long. WIfi is extremely limited to a few appliances only and is slow and not all over the place. TV programmes are very limited. Other lesser hotels do better. Anyway, once tasted, twice shy. Look for other bargains. It is also noisy due to incessant wedding and other events in the basement area.",3,w Nov 2020
25,Naksnansi,This is by far one of the best stay cations I have done in mumbai. I live in mumbai and booked taj lands end for a special occasion and boy did they take care of us. It almost felt like I had more people as part of the celebration and they were the hotel staff. I have always been impressed with Taj and its hospitality but this time I experienced it first hand.

27,Jayesh,"The famed Taj Hospitality is seen here except in the Vista Restaurant.  Still I will give it 5 star.  The check in was smooth and the staff were courteous.  No welcome drink or welcome chocolate.  But the smile was there.  Moved to the room in a jiffy.  Not many hotels do this.  The sea facing room is a dream.  You can sit for hours there.  The care taken to celebrate my daughter's birthday was visible everywhere.  A few minor hiccups like: It took hours to get a extra blanket and pillow, probably due to less staff.  And the visibly unbearably slow service in Vista restaurant.  Takes 30 minutes for an omelette or a dosa.  Took 1 hour to get a curd for the paratha.  When you have aloo paratha in breakfast, where is the curd.  The Taj smiles were missing in Vista.   But these…",5,rote a review Nov 2020

Instant cleaning of room with apologies tendered. Same evening in room dining services unable to handle order correctly. Have a missing dish and after repeated calling for another dish there is response but only on deaf ears. Had to sleep on an empty stomach that night. Morning am surrounded with staff and chefs to make my breakfast pleasant( great consolation with restaurant manager giving his number for any service desired.

Not one moment can I think where any of the hotel employees   slipped up. The place was always sanitised . All employees were wearing masks and face shields at all times and all the guests also on the property were acting very responsibly so safety was no concern at all. The food quality inspite  of the Covid times was excellent. The in room dining in particular was superb.

I gave my amex card which the machine didn’t accept, tried mastercard and that too didn’t work, tried paying cash but I was told no change was available, I lastly had to pay with my visa card. This happened twice the same night. It was scary because had my visa not worked at 1 in the night I would have been kicked out of the hotel.

But the room was not well equipped with double pax supplies. Had to ask for slippers, and then bathrobe which took an hour to deliver. All minibar glasses were dirty, room was dusty, and request took too long to deliver which is not expected from the brand hotel. There was no cake and any flowers which i had requested even during my reservation. One suggestion is to provide sanitisers and mask to the guest which other set of hotels are providing.   I feel services need to be improved. There was no call back in room to inform guest about closure of request, no one calls back for the queries too..

I hold Taj in very high esteem, so I fail to understand why the utter failure to maintain standards in the bathroom (uncleaned surfaces, indications that plumbing work had been done recently and not completely finished), and the minibar that had the look and feel of lemon tree furniture and also had no amenities and dirty wine glasses.   There was also a screw up with my check in and I had to spend 2 hours sorting out the issue or I would have been double charged..  Not a Taj experience at all and if I were you, pick another property",2,May 2020

70,TravisR,I had been to the Taj Lands End this month for a night and my expectations were overly fulfilled. The Duty Manager Ms. Kritika Lalwani really left a positive impression when she upgraded me to a larger well decorated suite as it was my birthday. I guess these small actions are what make our day. Super professional staff. Kudos to Ms. Lalwani and her staff. Overall had an amazing stay at the Lands End. Would for sure recommend my acquaintances to stay at this property.,5,Mar 2020

With a beautiful view of the sea from our spacious room, we enjoyed our entire stay at the property. The rooms are well appointed, the property itself is beautifully designed and elegantly luxurious. And true to the Tatas’ legacy, the staff is so welcoming that at no point do you feel like you’re in a hotel. It felt like home.   From wonderfully elaborate buffet breakfasts, where the chefs would happily rustle up anything you wanted to eat, to the absolutely amazing housekeeping staff who day in and day out, made sure to take care of all our needs, we couldn’t have asked for a better place to stay for 2 while weeks.

The buffet was great and the ambience was amazing, but the service was so slow and almost didn't bother. I ordered for a coke and it took them 45 minutes to bring it out (I had to ask 3 times to 3 different waiters and finally asked a manager). Most of our drinks came out after the meal. My dad asked for cold meat cuts- which they said they're happy to provide, but that too came way after we were done with desserts.   It was almost as if the wait staff didn't care. As someone who's been in hotels all over the world- it didn't live up to its name and reputation. However, the food was delicious and very good.",3,Mar 2020

And Ankush & Tejal from front office too. At the end our guests were happy with their stay and were taken care of perfectly. I couldn't have asked for a better team!

The view from the room is awesome, as it is facing the Arabian Sea & Bandra Worli Link. Its breakfast collection is also wonderful. They provide many variety of food, from local food to western food.

The housekeeping staff is also excellent—Vishnu, our cleaner, always kept the room spotless. Sebastian, who did the turn-down service, was so helpful—and did a great job. We loved coming back to our room every night.    Our only complaint with the hotel has to do with the live music at the bar.

Old furniture, old phones, not up to date information regarding hotel services, plumbing issues, etc. They try to compensate with the great attitude and service (for example room cleaning was the best I saw in the long time), but this does not work all the time due to seems to be some systemic issues.

From Ganesh and Bharat in the club lounge to Rajendra in housekeeping, they made the entire trip so pleasant, I almost did not feel like leaving! Breakfast in the club lounge was amazing.

The only bad experience we had was in the Vista restaurant for the a la carte dinner which took a long time and the quality was dissappointing.

Among Starters,I liked only Chickhen Malai Kebab and Paneer Tikka. It was well cooked and the taste was also good while the other starters was not all good because very less of masala powder and salt was used. The Green chutney was tastless. Among the main course, I liked only the Thai Curry while the Laal maas, rotis and Veg Biryani was not at all good. This Taj Lands end doesn`t have the taste like before. The Desserts were excellent.

I have been a regular at the hotel for last ten years and never found anything wanting. 100 marks to Team Taj Lands End",5, a review Oct 2019
207,Adarsh,"After spending one week at the taj lands end, heading to four seasons for the weekend and returning felt just right.   This is the best hotel I have stayed at. Not only due to the facilities it offers but due the exemplary service by the staff.   This is a massive shout out to aaina and simmy at la vista. Mr dipak in house keeping, you guys are simply the best! Thank you so much for your service! We left feeling you were part of our family.   GOODLUCK to the team at the taj and thank you for your hospitality! Unfortunately trip advisor ratings go only up to 5/5 I would give you 100/100",5,view Oct 2019

Mumbai is fortunate to have a medley of a dozen such gladiators from the older lot down South to the newer ones in Bandra and Andheri.

I found the rooms spacious and comfortable, with none of the plastic-disposable feel that plagues the Trident and Oberoi. The views are stunning and the staff quietly helpful and not overbearing.

The fountain is very soothing to the eyes. However, the reception staff needs to be courteous . The washrooms are very well maintained. The cleaning service department needs a hats off , coz they do the job pretty well. Overall, I loved the ambiance , view, food etc. But , I think the staff needs a lot of improvement.

I have been coming regularly to Taj Lands End, however it otherwise lacks in energy and enthusiasm. Very often we have business meetings and wait back to unwind with a couple of beers, good food and music.   So we especially like to come when Larissa is performing because it's a great vibe and uplifts the whole experience. We love the Taj hospitality, staff are very courteous and good service. So glad that the music is great too.   We prefer coming when Larissa performs and more than often, end up spending the whole evening at the Taj. It's certainly worth it!!",5,Jul 2019

While placing our order we had asked for recommendations and we were told that the Mutton Curry is their speciality.

It felt very understaffed. I was at breakfast early when they opened, and it was hard to find anyone to ask questions/make requests. But overall, the staff is still very friendly and very helpful.   Room: I was upgraded to a club room as they couldn't accommodate a twin bed request within my original category. The room had a comfy bed and a big bathroom. But other than that, nothing stood out.

No words of appreciation and praise will be enough for the amazing team there, especially the lovely young lady SIMMY, the ever smiling and caring gentleman ARUN and the so very efficient and helpful KEYU.   10 STARS 🌟 to them all and also to the Managers and General Manager of this Hotel for having such a fantastic and committed team.   They were all so kind, respectful and caring to my family and they did everything they could to make my father feel special and happy with the entire dining experience there.

343,ACollo,"The Taj group really know how to make you feel welcome and special as a guest of their hotels. I stayed at the Taj Lands End in a ‘Taj Club’ room for a month, on a business trip.  Their attention to detail and the numerous small gestures made the stay wonderful.  I left a pair of glasses on the desk and returned to find a lens cleaning cloth.  They fixed a broken wheel on my suitcase.  They gave me a farewell cake and flowers on the days before my check out.   The location in Bandra is on the coast, which meant I could walk or jog along the promenade (although, the promenade is not as nice as that in South Mumbai).  It is also at the start of the Sealink bridge into the central business district and is convenient for the airport.  ",5,Jun 2019
344,Sunil,"The problem with Taj Hotels is that they are becoming synonymous to a government organisation.  They are taking their customers for granted, because they are THE Taj.   After two years, despite being a Taj Inner circle member, I chose to recently stay once again at Taj Lands End in Mumbai.  The last experience was very poor.  I thought that after two years, they would not do an Air India on me.  But it was worse than Air India.    The rooms, which was supposed to have a view of the deep “blue” ocean, in fact has the view of a dirty ocean.  Not only that, the room was grubby & shabby, and I am not even sure if they sanitise them before a new arrival !  I was placing my clothes in the cupboard, and my undergarments in the drawers.  When I opened the drawer, I found an empty bottle…",1,UK wrote a review Jun 2019

The rooms are well fitted with a good level of amenities etc. The room I had was showing signs of being a little tired with wear and tear issues though. The decor isn’t a modern style but nevertheless very comfortable and adequate.   Free Wi-Fi isn’t fast, so to watch videos etc you have to pay for the premium internet.   I had a buffet lunch at the restaurant and while the choice of food was limited (weekends is far better) there were some very tasty curry and a roast chicken choice.   The lobby bar looked amazing although I didn’t get to try it out.   All in all, if you want a good hotel that isn’t…",5,Jun 2019

349,Parth147,Firstly the view from our room 1102 wasn’t good at all. All what we could see was big iron rod structure. Secondly on Saturday night there was some event on a floor lower than our room and the music was loud and it went on till 4:30 in the morning. Thirdly at House of Nomad we were informed about the dress code of no SHORTS allowed for males but we saw some guest wearing shorts. On asking your staff they informed about the timing of shorts being allowed. We were never told about any timing on asking your staff. The guest who was wearing shorts was in House of Nomad way beyond the allowed time. Lastly on our check out we had to inform and ask for our discount amount which was already mentioned in our booking email. ,2,Jun 2019

However whenever I stay at Taj Lands End it feels like I am back at home.  To experience similar you have to stay here. Taj as a hotel group describe something call Tajness.

It was also my dads birthday this day, which was the reason for our trip, so waiting around ruined all lunch plans we had, and also it took 1.5 hours for them to get us the correct rooms, which then also ruined our evening plans as we were waiting around for our rooms to be ready and luggage to be delivered.

The rooms, the bathrooms, attention to the guests requirements, courteous staff was all very wonderful but I could not accept freshly laundered blood-stained sheets with dried brown stains - obviously, the housekeeping had not been diligent. Another issue in the Dining Room was unclean smelly glasses not thoroughly washed and rinsed. I hope these issues will be addressed as I brought it to the notice of the Management.

639,Steve,"As my previous reviews confirm, I am a great fan of the Taj Hotels brand but my latest stay at the Lands End is likely to be my last?  The reason is nothing to do with the property itself which remains as good as ever with consistently high service levels but the room rates. Without quoting the actual figures - but using identical room categories - the costs of my 2 night stay (for which I was upgraded to an Executive Suite) is 33% and 100% (yes 100%) higher than at comparative Taj properties in Delhi and Chennai respectively.   When raising the matter with the Management I was given a very sympathetic hearing but alas nothing tangible could be done. This is unfortunate and will probably result in my staying elsewhere on my next visit to Mumbai!",4,w Nov 2018

The Executive Lounge needs some updating also. On the positive side, the staff who made up my room were incredibly attentive with several small touches that were impressive.

The Bar - Nomad gets very busy after 12.30 midnight on Friday and Saturday. The bartenders are very friendly. Unfortunately the DJ was very fixed in what he wanted to play.

701,Kajari,"As always, Taj Hotels offer a great Customer Service in comparision with other chains. The food is also excellent-the widest range in breakfast/mild dishes sefved as part of room service/etc.Landsend in Bandra, Mumbai has an excellent location and is very accessible from any part of Mumbai. So, the view from the deluxe rooms is worth dying for. For film buffs, both Shahrukh Khan's house Mannat & Salman Khan's house is on the way.The only area of improvement is that the decor is a bit dated and could do with a refresh.",4,w Oct 2018

705,De,Taj lands ends defines hospitality in true spirits in lines with any other Taj Hotel. Only difference is Taj Lands End takes you to a step higher in luxury. The rooms are immaculately done and the view of Sea link is exhilarating. The hotels offers all varieties of options for fine dining along with multi level spread of buffet. The staff is very warm and gentle and are there to assist you always with a smiling demeanour. Staying in Taj Lands End in as experience in itself which is simply unmatched.,5, review Oct 2018

Taj Lands End is right besides Band Stand such that you can just walk down to Band Stand. From the reception desk to house keeping,  the staff is extremely courteous and professional. The room I stayed in had a sea facing window and though I din get too much time , it was too good and peaceful to just look at the sea. Their breakfast spread is amazing and you would be surprised by the variety they have.....

Also don't miss your chance to have a look at Shahrukh khan and Salman khan's houses.Both houses are located  near the hotel.  Cleanliness is good.  I suggest the hotel management  to check the possibility of shifting the breakfast area to a location which would give a 360 degree of the sea.Currently only few sections of the breakfast area can enjoy the sea view.,4,Oct 2018

No doubt Taj Mahal palace is classic one but   choose Taj Land end as it in very quite area.  We had 1 night stay in beautiful luxury suite after 3 days hectic schedule in Mumbai.  This is very quite place for relaxation from crowded Mumbai :-).  I had booked Luxary sew view room but staff upgraded my room to Grand Luxury suite which was perfect gift after 2 days hectic schedule.

I was also offered a surprise upgrade and a room facing the sea, which was beyond my expectations. The room's amenities and comfort were matching my expectations - nothing falling short. Food was excellent and diverse, which makes you try everything that is on the list. Alright, the questions that arise now are "" What is so great? Does not this happen in every such hotel?""

Where the Land ends and infinite seas begin.  And that is where the Taj Stands, in all it's glory. A place so blessed by nature that u will almost cease to care the flurry of celebrities roaming it's grand lobby and ofcourse the detailed luxury which Taj is known for.  I had the pleasure of staying here for almost a week and trust me when I say this,  despite all the glamour and luxury surrounding you, the View from your room is all that u will care about.

The staff are really what makes this hotel amazing. Everyone was incredibly polite, pleasant, extremely attentive and helpful. Rooms were cleaned everyday; then the manager checks on each room to ensure guests are happy and also provide water if you need. There were like 5 bottles of water in the room everyday!

The club room I was staying was great with nice bed and amenities and the handiness of the lounge being available there next door. Being a sucker for Indian food, I still went down to their coffee shop on mezzanine floor and was amazed by their breakfast selection.. special mention to the way they serve the masala chai for sure. We used the business centre for our meetings and they were also great experience and service standards were maintained therein as well... same for their lounge bar which was a nice hangout place.

726,Sanaya,Had a wonderful stay at Taj Landsend Mumbai. The hotel is situated in a very good location where even if one has work in south Mumbai one can take the sealink and be there in no time. The reason we choose this hotel time and again is because of the great hospitality which makes us feel at home. From the check in till check out we had great service. If one loves Chinese food one must not miss out to taste the food at Ming Yang restaurant. They also have a great tea manu which goes along with chinese food. People who love Indian must try out Nalli Niahari at Masala Bay restaurant. I wish the entire team all the best and a bright future ahead. ,5,rote a review Sep 2018

From one end you can see the sea link and from other the hustle and bustle of BANDRA. Located literally at lands end, view here is worth all the pain you have to take while crossing the sea of people mongering around homes of celebs like Shahrukh khan, salman khan and many others.

Not sure what happened this time, but upon arriving with luggage, no one really helped us unload baggage and take up the steps to baggage screening. Had to do on our own. I finally told one guy working that was on his phone to hang up and help us out, which he did. The other issue is that one would expect 1, if not both toilet paper holders to have toilet paper.

In any case the Taj lawns which are said to be ""sea facing"" are actually slum/huts facing and you need to actually get a stage erected sea side to avoid the eye-sore.

771,Priya,Taj is one of the finest properties in India. I went to Mumbai for some official purpose and stayed two for nights in Taj Lands End. The Property will give a Wow feeling from outside since it’s not very furnished but the interior will definitely give you magnificent feeling. That’s exactly what I felt when I entered the Hotel.  We checked in the room and the moment I removed the curtains​ ​Ah...It was breath taking. I fall in love with their rooms just because of their Sea view. One who is going there should book a sea facing room otherwise you guys gonna miss the morning view. The room was pretty much good and spacious.  Food was also good. We had their buffet breakfast which was excellent. They kept every possible thing to eat considering their customers choice.,5,review Aug 2018

The property remains a very good one but the thing that stands out the most is the service levels - from the moment you check-in to when you check-out. In particular. I was impressed with the front desk staff, both the Club Lounge and Housekerping teams and my driver Haroon who took me to and from the Willingdon Club.

If I return to Mumbai in the future I would certainly opt to stay in this hotel.  The hotel was in its own segregated complex. Upon arrival we were greeted in a friendly way before going through a security process that seemed the norm in India.  All bags and people were scanned but quite comically if the body scanner went off you were just waved through without further checks whilst there was no visibility of people actually checking the x-ray for bags although I’m sure they probably were.

The view from our room was totally gratifying and we spent the entire Sunday watching the ferocious ocean crash into the rocks and what a sight it was.   If one is planning a leisure trip here, it makes sense to go for their club rooms as it opens a host of other services besides breakfast.

Not ideal if you want to travel to South Mumbai but I did during my stay and travel time is the only consideration.   Highlight though is the views, only comparison in Mumbai is the Taj Palace and perhaps Oberoi/Trident Nariman Point.   I would prefer this hotel over the ones in BKC.

848,mtrewis,Arrived around 3 AM in April and requested a quiet room non-smoking. Apparently if there was such a room it was not held for us - we were stuck on a smoking floor which smelled noxious in the hall (no hotels I know of in North America permit smoking in rooms) and our neighbours were a steady stream of party-goers. Complaints to the hotel were heeded one night - neighbours were moved - but the final night there was no option for us but to move ourselves. Manager said he had no choice (?) but to give the room to noisy people. An odd response to complaint - if we had been given a quiet non-smoking room the first night perhaps there would have been no reason to complain.  Otherwise the food was magnificent - buffet as good as anything I have ever seen or tasted  - and the general…,3,Jun 2018

The hotel is nicely done and the flower arrangements in the lobby and other public areas are just beautiful.

For example, my male colleague and I arrived at the same time to the hotel.  He was greeted with ""sir this way"" ""sir may I take your luggage"" etc.  I on the other hand was not greeted. In what looked like an attempt to further help my colleague, a bell boy did take my luggage to the check in counter. The check in lady spoke to my colleague, took his name, his reservation, etc. until he spoke up and said hey - she needs to check in too, we aren't together.""

While it certainly feels more modern / business like than the mahal (which has its own unique luxury), the service was very good - particularly Sumit at the front desk and the concierge on duty - both of whom went out of their way to help and make my stay as easy and comfortable as possible. Very impressed ! Didn’t have the opportunity to try the restaurants on site but the in room dining was good, and the chef was happy to change up the standard dishes on request.

Yes, there were a few minor niggles. We did point them out and then felt bad because of the managers were overly mortified. Yes they do take quality of service very seriously.

912,A,"I enjoyed staying at this hotel. The room was great and the hotel had all the amenities, with a great view and superb location- arguable one of the best in mumbai. The main gripe I had was the inconsistent service- they sometimes struggle with high peak demand ( e.g. Saturday nights with large wedding groups staying at the hotel) in servicing everyone to a consistently high standard. Another example of inconsistent service was the service at buffet breakfast where the staff were not as attentive as they could be. Most of the time, it was great  service but let down on a few occasions. These are small issues, however consistent exceptional service is expected for a hotel of this caliber.  Nevertheless, I would recommend this hotel to the traveler visiting Mumbai.",4,w Apr 2018

Housekeeping was diligent, with amenities all duly replenished without fail.

The hotel has Feng Shui; its lounge is open and spacious, shops and restaurants  on the first floor. Do not  miss the Indian restaurant in the hotel; I've eaten the best lamb I've had for a long time. And try kulfi; the Indian desert which is like ice cream with twist. Also if you are a female , the boutique  called Shiriin has some bargains; good value slippers and bags.  The breakfast was wonderful; for both Inidan and European   tastes. Sip some masala tea on the terrace when having breakfast. They serve walking around in a colourful tea pot. If you need a cheaper taxi than the hotel's own, here is our…",5,Feb 2018

This time, in February 2018 in room 1740 and 1742, I was absolutely disappointed. The rooms were not upto the mark with broken toilet seats, then the breakfast experience was absolutely horrendous on all the 5 days we stayed there. I really wish this would change but for now, I will give a 1 star on trip advisor.

It makes perfect sense to stay here as it is right in the heart of the city and travel to either the North or the South of the city is just comfortable, preferably if you plan to travel to the South.

The location of the hotel is fantastic very calm & serene situated in the posh residential area of Bandra west and is well connected to south Mumbai via sea link making it a breeze to travel in all directions including the airport. The staff were very helpful and house keeping was almost round the clock that meant whatever time we stepped out of the room and requested housekeeping to do our rooms they readily obliged with a smile..

There was a large insurance conference going on and sometimes you waited for an elevator for more than 5 minutes and when it finally came it would be full of people so you had to wait even longer. Also on the second day there was some work going on in the room above ours and that too in the afternoon and I had to call the guest relations executives 5 times before the work stopped after 45 minutes, at which point there was no point trying to get a rest.

Security tried to calm the situation but were not successful. Breakfast was excellent but the staff were all new and did not do a good job serving. I witnessed a gentleman (I guess maybe Manager) yelling and talking rudely to the new staff which in my opinion is very very wrong and inappropriate.

Most of the staff are extremely friendly. I checked for Christmas weekend to finish a work project, use the facilities, and have someone else make the coffee. The first evening. I took a guest to Ming Yang, their premier Chinese restaurant. Despite 4 nights booking and a 2 day advance reservation, we were shown to a side room with no other guests; a drapery was opened to give us a view of main dining room. Everything went down from there. Inconsistent service, forgotten ordered items. The next morning, an issue with coffee.

Staff do go out of their way to make you feel welcome although five different waiters taking it in turns (and somewhat uncoordinated) every minute or so to ask if your food is OK is perhaps a little OTT for most. Room was a good size but as we were there peak season very expensive for what you get. High (ish) levels of security so does feel safe. Its a bit pompous and stuffy in places (a dress code) but not overly so, all felt a little restrained and every one on their best behaviour. Breakfast was good with a wide choice to cater for all.

The hotel has the ""classic"" luxury feel to it,   some may find it old fashion.   House of Nomad the gastropub is a great place for casual, modern food. Great wine list, cocktails are pretty standard.              Rooms are big and specious. Suggest the hotel have a look at the toiletries, the clear plastic that they are in had black marks on them.

Though it was a short and quick stay, I had mixed reactions in the short time I had. The check in process was smooth but the only room available was on the smoking floor which was not to my liking. The room was exquisitely designed though I didn’t get the sea view, as I got the pool view which was not why I was planning to stay at this place given that the hotel has a great view of the sea!

Feels good which for me is very important as a frequent traveller. Fantastic restaurant on first floor, Masala Bay which I reviewed in a separate review. Chefs cooking are passionate about food themselves. Great breakfast if you're a breakfast person. If you're not, it's still a great breakfast.

Breakfast spread was good enough to stretch you till lunch . Nice pool to chill out , I didn’t use it though . The only thing that bothered me was the elevator , had to wait 10-15 minutes .

Instead of sea view , we got looking at the drawn down slates because otherwise their AC would not cool the dining space  seriously ?

I knew this is a relatively old property, so my expectations weren't exactly sky high and the first impressions are that of a hotel well past its prime. The rooms are spacious and clean but small things like a broken table clock seemed to suggest a certain lack of upkeep. None of these, however, warrant a one star review. What tipped it over the edge for me was construction work in the hotel in the dead of the night.  After a long flight, i eventually managed to get into my room at 230am hoping for some sleep before an early morning meeting. Exactly 15mins later, somewhere on the floor above some one decided it was a great time to drill some nails and shift furniture.

Was put in a room which was being refurbished and work was being carried out outside it and the lifts. The floor was covered with debris and the room smelt of paint and varnish. By the morning had been poisoned by the chemicals.   this was compounded by the fact that the food served in its restaurant where breakfast i served was cold. I also ate their Indian restaurant - this too was equally poor. The food bland and cold for the price paid.

This property is situated right next to Arabian sea and you can have a look of Worli sea link from your room. Rather than going anywhere on long weekend of Gandhi Jayanti, we planned to stay at Taj lands end and enjoy Mumbai. While reaching to hotel, you pass through famous Mannat Mansion, home of Shahrukh Khan and see lots of people clicking photos. Location of hotel i ideal and the lobby is massive and impressive.

As a tourist, one might prefer the charm of a boutique hotel in one of Bandra's inner lanes, but not as a business traveler (and even as a tourist, dispensing with the Taj's view would be... difficult).

The toilets in the rooms need to be improved. And at night and early morning, some of the staff was noisy almost every day. The quality of the breakfast is very good, although the restaurant is overcrowded everyday especially between 8 and 9h. Finally, the music coming from the bar should be less  loud. When you are inside there is no way you can hear each other and have a conversation. It also interferes with the lobby when you are sitting there.

At every turn, the customer service is unparalleled from the time you walk into their lobby and receive a welcome garland, to the moment they drop you at the airport in their SUV. Do stay in one of the rooms overlooking the sea and Bandra Band Stand--the view is mesmerizing. While they have many specialty restaurants and shops, Vista restaurant is open 24 hours with a sumptuous buffet (breakfast included in some room rates)! The pool is fabulous and they also have a great gym. But most importantly are the Taj Lands End staff, who do their very best to make your stay exceptional.

This time we were staying on our way back home for our wedding anniversary and I was less impressed. We asked for a Sealink view room and were given an older style room on the fourth floor which reminded me of a hotel from the 1970's. To make matters worse, the sound of construction was coming through the walls so clearly they were renovating. We complained and asked to be moved a modern renovated room on the upper floors, to have the staff basically lie and say the construction noise is present in the whole hotel during daytime. Not giving up, we still insisted on being moved, which was eventually reluctantly done and we moved to a renovated room…",3,Jul 2017

The staff are all tentative and friendly, without being pushy. The pool is lovely and the breakfasts marvellous.  In short I wouldn't stay anywhere else in Branda.  If I was pushed to find fault, one would be as a yearly guest for over a decade it would be nice for the reception staff to have records so they can say 'welcome back' rather than, is this your first visit here, and a refreshing of the atrium bar menu would be welcomed!

Happy hour was a joke as there were no appetizers and drinks took more than 45 mins to arrive. What's the point in booking a club room with club lounge!  Breakfast area is poorly managed, with simple orders like paratha taking 30-40 mins to arrive. If you leave your table, it is likely that the table will be cleared by the time you are back. The breakfast area host's behavior, can be best described as condescending.

1252,djpinkerton,"I have stayed at a few different Taj hotels and enjoyed them all.  Lands End rooms are nice but perhaps not as nice as the newer Santa Cruz or Bangalore hotels but the ambience and vibe is far nicer at Lands End.  The food at Lands End was fabulous and the service was exceptional.  Lands End is on the waterfront, it is not a nice beach and you would never consider swimming or even dipping your feet. However it provides a good opportunity to walk and people watch.  I will visit again ",4,Jun 2017

However, the reason I have rated the overall experience average is because their customer service levels pale in comparison to many comparable hotels I have stayed at in India.    Right from the point of check in, there were issues with my check in process (at the Club Lounge no less!), a very noisy set of rooms on day two with drilling directly above, and slow service at times.

1267,Mayank,"Taj Lands end is a woderful property at the edge of the sea, with lovely views of Mumbai. Wonderful hospitality - the taj signature is the differentiator. The upper floors have undergone renovation and hence  given a choice it's preferable to stay in the 20th and above floors. Also, better to take rooms facing the sea and outside as against those with an inside view. Has a decent selection of restaurants - good but not great. Spa is very nice, and the outdoor swimming pool is also pretty decent (if you are okay with crows, pigeons around the pool). Has a location advantage as the hub of Bandra is 10 mins away. Wonderful for a weekend getaway - gives you calm in the middle of the city.",4,w Jun 2017

1274,Rhona,I have stayed in a few Taj hotels and was so disappointed with the service at this hotel. Stayed for 4 nights and on more than one occasion service let them down. Attention to detail around the food provision (both in restaurant and breakfast take away) was lacking and poor. An example is ordered a breakfast to go as leaving hotel at 630am - specified and agreed contents the night before - contents not the same as we agreed and just no thought i.e. Gave a yoghurt with no spoon!  Normally you get brilliant service but delivery on requests were just not answered. A shame as rooms nice enough (not anything special tbh) and facilities good. ,2,w Jun 2017

We ended up in Mumbai due to a family emergency so wasn't the best situation but the taj really made it wonderful from start to finish. I would like to thank you all so much.

BLC is somewhat remote, but a key business area, Marine Drive very busy and noisy but close to all the key visitor attractions, but Lands End is offers neither proximity to key business areas or prime attractions.

The pool and gardens are quiet and offer an oasis from the hub-bub of the shoreline, the public areas impressive and the staff are precisely what you might expect of any 5* hotel.

Juhu and Andheri are around a 35 minute drive going north.(As always-depending upon Mumbai traffic...) but these are fair estimates. This hotel is a great week-end getaway if you live here. If you are from out of town it is a great location....in the middle of everything... ",5,May 2017

One of the most hospitable hotels I have stayed in, thus far.  Ms. Shivi helped pick a room with a wonderful view of the sea, Worli sea link, the hotel pool and lawns.  The housekeeping staff and the personal touches they add while making the room leaves you smiling.  The gentleman at the concierge was very helpful.  We enjoyed the breakfast buffet every single day and a great part of the credit goes to Mr. Brinston, who takes such good care of all the guests.

None of this is mentioned when booking, nor at check in where no noise can be heard.  A different story upstairs where the noise is akin to 1980's Costa Del Sol where at least the building work was normally not IN the actual hotel! Drilling, hammering and banging lasts from 9am to 6pm six days per week so no Saturday lie in either. On most floors the noise is unbearable; the upper most floors 24 and 25 should be better but are the most expensive and normally fully booked.

Our suite over looked the Arabian Sea on the 25th floor, the service was impeccable from the moment we stepped into the hotel to the moment we left.

1403,arabyabdelsadika,It is very important to give attention to the departure of your gest. It seems that every body is looking to get something before leaving.

Would they have done something like this to a foreigner / VIP ? I doubt.",4,Apr 2017

Then i recollected  that my last stay was in Dec 2016 and i can write about this excellent property. Each hotel have some plus points but if you have to choose hotel which has everything it will be TAJ LANDS END.

The mini bar check list of previous guest had not been cleared and also the earlier guest's welcome card has been left in the room.

One of the worst experiences in a Taj group from the time taken to check-in, to the room availability, to the quality of the room - let's not forget about the restaurant which had stained napkins and cutlery which wasn't washed and cleaned upto the minimum standard.

I joined him for a night.   We stayed in a club room with amazing views of the Arabian Sea. The room was typical Taj with all equipped with luxurious amenities. The bathroom was very spacious the best part was the commode which had an auto showering facility. It also would warm up the toilet seat!    The rest of the facilities are top rated at this hotel. I used the swimming pool and jacuzzi which was climate controlled.   The location of the hotel is perfect as it's in the middle of the city half way to the airport and town.

Lived in bandra for 23 years and was absolutely blown away by this property when I was visiting back home early this year.  The property really speaks for itself but the one thing which I would definitely like to mention is the eye for detail the staff has here.  Lay out glasses they put out a lens cleaner, leave a book on he desk they leave behind a bookmark.  Hospitality to a completely different level.   You will not want to leave!!!!!

The hotel is quite nicely done with courteous and helpful staff. The rooms are spacious. I was on the 14th flr room and it was very comfortable. They gave a fruit platter complimentary in the room. the toiletries provided in the bathroom are of Body Shop and hence good quality.

Those are just some of the details you find at the Taj.  The rooms are nicely and the bathroom is very large with separate shower, toilet room, and bath tub.   Banquet services staff are great too.

If you are a Bollywood fan you will find homes of Bollywood stars within walking distance :)  2)Hotel staff is very helpful and service is great.  3)Rooms are super spacious. Please ask for a sea facing room. The views are amazing (Check the pics)  Some suggestions :  It's an old property so lifts need some upgrade. I have to wait long time for lifts.

I stayed at the hotel in Feb for 3 nights & after having stayed at multiple other 5 star hotels in Mumbai I have to say that the property is now dated & in urgent need of an overhaul.

On my previous stay months ago in a different city, I had forgotten to take safety pins for my sari and had to make an SoS Call to the guest services department at the Taj requesting for pins..this time they preempted the call. The second thing I noticed was a plug Point at an accessible level. My pet grouse in most hotels is having to crawl under the table to Plug my laptop and mobile and having too few plug points. These are the little things that make you fall in love with services at the Taj. When staying at the Landsend, ask for a sea facing Room if you know you will be there to witness a sunset.

Breakfast buffet was incredibly delicious and wasn't the same every morning. Make sure you ask for a to go bag and a plastic container is the only tip I can give.

Staff is friendly and welcoming and answer to your queries at the earliest. Eating options are plenty - Food at Vista is also good. The hotel also has other restaurants such as Ming Yang , however I have not eaten there.

Service is the key word in this hotel and you feel cocooned in their warmth and hospitality. The room facing north has a good view of the Arabian sea and also one can see stretching away in the horizon the beach meandering towards Juhu beach!! I need to specially mention the  housekeeping staff..they are truly well trained and have the magic special touch. The guest relations service is another area where the hotel notches up some more points.  Food is great and both their breakfast and lunch buffets are a real treat for the foodies. My only area of concernis the lifts!!..One's patience is truly tested waiting for the lifts.,4,Mar 2017

I choose this property as it has a great view and great service  which we receive at the hotel every time we go.  This hotel is very safe for single lady travelers also.  One must not miss the delicious Chinese food at Ming Yang and you could be lucky if Sushant is serving you there as he will take care of your likes and dislikes.  The hi tea at the Club Lounge is a must as it gives such a great view of the Arabian Sea and the services by Noshirwan and Tyson are so prompt with perfection.  The Vista restaurant staff is also very welcoming. I am gonna choose Landsend on my next visit which is gonna be in few days. I strong recommend this hotel to all.,5,rote a review Mar 2017

Also Mr Birnstin n Uday at vista were very nice n courteous.   Check in was not great n the front desk seems to be working in silos.  One person will politely come n tell to be seated n then forget.  This is when u see that  most of the desks are not occupied.  Finally i had to get up n ask to expedite n complete the check in formality. Overall place n property is good.,4,Mar 2017

Once we complained the rest of the days were a joyful experience. I would give special thanks to Harshit and the team of the club lounge for the amazing service thereafter. Left on a great note and would definitely visit back later for a family holiday. ",5,w Mar 2017

The service is excellent and the dining options are vast, all are delicious. Their poolside is also great. One minor gripe is that they charged me something like Rs. 375 for a tea bag and hot water by the pool. I know next time to have the (same kind of) tea in my room (for FREE!).

Hotel is very neat and beautiful, nice scenic view facing the bridge and Arabian Sea, drawback is having a lot of crows flying around, in the swimming pool area, and outdoor breakfast balcony area. This is very annoying, but I guess not much they can do about it.  Lobby area is huge, but I don't really know the function of Concierge, Counter, and Front-Desk, as I already directed to another counter when I need something to clarify. for example, shuttle to airport, luggage arrangement.

Like in the Reception when I first inquired about extending my stay, Reception said not possible later a Duty Manager sorted it out. Obviously being an Hotelier, I know how these things work, and the response given by the Receptionist showed me he lacks empathy towards my request and needs some more training. Otherwise all good and enjoyed the F&B Service except the lobby bar where the service is as slow as a slow motion train. At one time a coffee took 30 minutes to arrive not sure what happen, and one time they forgot my Green Tea order.  Conference Team and facilities are great. No issues there.

We we first assigned rooms over looking their banquet area. They had a music event lined up for that evening. The sound check for the same started at 1 pm. Our windows and beds were vibrating thanks to this noise. It's appalling that a hotel would take up an event like this when they Have residents staying and paying. I complained about this to 2 receptionists and neither got back with any answer. I finally gave up my afternoon nap and went to the lobby and met this helpful gentleman Ray ( forgetting his first name)who found us rooms in a more quieter corner of the hotel.

There is whole lot of staff standing here but they forgot to offer me water let alone a welcome drink as is the norm.  They are so busy talking among themselves they forget they are there for the guests.  I have very specific preferences for a room and I made them when I made the reservation, but despite that I was given a room far from the elevator in some corner without a sea view (although they claim all rooms have sea view they do not).

Breakfast was at Alfresco and the dinner and lunch we had there were quite good as well.   The room i stayed in was garden view and the opposite rooms had a view of the sea. I don't think there is a room with a view of the Sea Link but you can see it from the corridors. The rooms are well equipped and the only downside is there is no bumwasher in the toilet.

Booked at the last minute before doing much shopping on the rates and offers, I was provided the best rate. Being a TIC Gold Member, I was upgraded to the next category of room. The best was when I asked them to customise the Chicken Tandoori at 1am and made it exactly the way I wanted with 2 leg pieces. Whilst it was not a part of the standard all day dining menu, I was obliged with the request on both the nights I stayed.

Room quality is great and staff is very polite and always taking care of you. Masala Bay and Ming Yang are my favourite place to dine. Its always great to meet Chef David and talk to him. This time I specially thank Mr Praveen General Manager and his secretary Pearl to help in booking my trip from Canada. They are awesome. I definitely recommend Taj Land ends…,5,w Feb 2017

What wise recommendation for the best in class. The Taj Lands End, Mumbai offers the ultimate in hospitality. Dr Neslyn is no stranger to class hotels and I have to let you know that the Taj Lands End surpass all others. I overheard someone to say: whenever I come to India, there are attempts to book me into other hotels, but I will go nowhere else and people have to come to me at the Taj. I was so impressed with what I heard that I had to ask the lady in question what leads her to make such statement. She commented: The positive energy at the Taj is second to none.

One could feel the difference in the food which is deliciously good to meet all tastes and likes: whether one likes European,Indian, or south Indian cuisine and  you are lucky enough you can meet Indian celebrities for some quick selfies. It goes without saying that the staff leaves no stone inturned to please their guests (like keeping my excess luggage even after checkout)",5,w Feb 2017

I stayed at the Taj Bengal, Taj Tashi, The Oberoi Mumbai and The Oberoi Bengaluru.  In keeping with the adage 'if you don't have something good to say, don't say anything at all"" - Well, the bad stuff of my stay goes directly to the hotel management of Taj Lands End for them to take care of in the way that they know best, that's the least I can do to honor the martyrs who worked for these iconic Indian brands.

The rooms are spacious and lovely,with nice bathrooms and decent power showers. The staff are gracious and helpful, you feel well-looked after. Breakfast on the terrace is a relaxed, leisurely affair with ample choice in the menu, great views wherever you look. I did not get to try out the gym or swimming pool, so cannot comment but the pool definitely looks very inviting. The only slight letdown was the Chinese restaurant Ming Yang - for those prices I expected a superlative quality of food, but it was merely 'good' and no more.",4,Feb 2017

1623,sachin,"Stayed in the hotel for two nights. The bedside has a master control for alarm , lights, ac and curtains. The control forever was conking off and the master to master control was inside the cupboard of your room. So at midnight the ac went off or int e da time the curtains did not open, you had to summon he maintenance guys. To be fair they came promptly and were competent and put things back in order. But the problem was that in two days had to call them at least 5 times. It became stressful as one did not know when the light or ac will stop working and you would be left pushing buttons.  A real dampener for an otherwise fantastic property with great service. Taj should quickly look into it for this kind of shoddy automation, won't risk saying again.",3,w Jan 2017
1624,Indian_Worldviewer,"Disclaimer: my visit here was actually in Apr 2014 but TA isn't giving me that year as an option, so I chose 2016.   My husband and I stayed at the Taj Mahal Palace immediately after our wedding. Our experience there was so wonderful that we decided to spend all our coming anniversaries at different Taj properties. And so we did - until we visited Taj Land's End.   We couldn't travel out of the city for this anniversary, so I surprised my husband by making a booking in this hotel within Mumbai.   1) The AC didn't function - We wanted to take an afternoon nap. It was terribly sunny, and the AC just wouldn't cool the room. Somebody was sent in to fix it but there was no resolution.

The staff were great; the breakfast was fantastic; the bed was terrifically comfortable and the room was really well equipped. My only negative comment is about the prices which were incredibly expensive - we paid at least double what we had paid in other luxury hotels in India for a couple of beers and a small meal - in fact, considerably more than we would have paid in the UK.

I was given an upgrade to a grand luxury room at a economical price and loved the room with lovely sealink view. The property is high end and the newly renovated rooms are state of the art. The facilities of the hotel are very good. Since we were there on the Christmas night, we got to enjoy a party organized by the hotel. I specifically liked the temperature controlled pool and a hot water Jacuzzi.  To look at the downside, this is a business hotel and lack activities for kids. Other than the pool, you don't have much for the kids to explore.",5,Jan 2017

Upon check-in, we were given a flower garland and a kind lady performed a little ritual where in she blessed us with good health. Coming to the check-in procedure itself, we were checked-in by a lady from Guest Relations Department. While the process was smooth and quick, it seemed like a rather forced procedure wherein there was a slight sense of disconnect between the staff member and us. In short, the procedure left something to be desired…. On the other hand, we were provided with a beautiful room on a high floor, with a stunning view.

The service here is truly top notch as I recalled from my previous stay a few years ago. Club Floor privileges and butler service with a special mention to Mr Tyson George who leads an incredible team on the 21st floor club lounge where the staff take pleasure in anticipating and remembering guests needs and preferences.

They promptly and graciously found me a room with a king sized bed.   Breakfast was decent. It was a good spread if you also ate Indian style breakfast. Unfortunately for me, my palate was limited to the freshly made dosas and the western options - eggs (any style), chicken sausages, baked beans, potatoes and toast.

Special shout-out to Himesh at the concierge and Poojari our driver for going above and beyond to ensure our stay and our sightseeing trips were exceptional. The food at the Masala Bay restaurant was the best food we've had in our 3 weeks in India. The room and the gym facilities were definitely what you would expect from a 5 star hotel.

Francis the main restaurant manager was fantastic as ever and offered a full tour of all the desserts. New this year was the outside breakfast, worth experiencing. The pool was fabulous as ever.

From the time we checked in & we requested for someone to show us around the hotel facilities (which hasn't till day 3), to the dead phone in the room, to lack of any basic fruit basket, to the TV going dead today, etc, the experience is quite average or below. Considering that we have been patronising Taj for over 16 years now, this was not at all expected.

Hot tea served in small glasses as it used to be in trains was a good nostalgia touch, and was good. Bread choices were not good, all types were crumbly. Overall decent choice of dishes.

On our way back to the airport I asked my 6 year old daughter regarding what she liked about our mumbai trip. She answered in a flash, "" I LIKED 3 THINGS, THE HOTEL, THE ROOM AND THE FOOD"".

We visited major tourist attractions like gateway of india, elephanta caves, imagica theme park and snow park,  palladium and all other adjoining malls etc.  Well Taj employees made it a memorable experience for her right from the moment she stepped in the hotel.

The rooms with sea views - full or partial - are worth paying more for: the view ought to destress you to some extent.   The hospitality is Taj typical. Not Shangri-la  uber-pro, not Oberoi we-know-how but mostly efficient and homely.   The rooms are nice but some could do with a refit. Those that have been refurbished are very nicely done - even if they have a few unsatisfactory odds and ends (like a rather unfinished socket well - with blunt sawed plywood and unfinished edges; shaky drawers in the closet).

Yes, there are flashier and more luxurious 5 star hotels in Mumbai, but the hospitality extended by the staff at the Taj Lands End is without equal.

From the amazing housekeeping staff (many of them with disabilities) to the team that run the excellent restaurants, all of them provide a world class experience that's synonymous with a stay at a Taj.   I would really like to mention one member of staff that really made my stay memorable and that's Ashish in the Vista restaurant.

There was also a complimentary cake provided by the hotel as a gesture to wish us on the special day!!The only drawback were the green lights being reflected as a result of a wedding in the night. Overall a superb experience!,5,Dec 2016

The hotel is on the same lane which houses India's movie superstars...so it was like living in India's ""Beverly Hills"".   Besides that fantasy, the hotel has got an easy access from the airport. The security, concierge, business centre, F&B staff, service staff (Don Rodriques) to help me organize my event were friendly and very supportive. The food spread for our business delegates were well appreciated. The pool area is good and vibrant. The breakfast spread has got variety.   Two areas where I was not satisfied with Taj Lands End and I am sure given its brand and stature in India the management will overcome the shortages.   Shortage # 1 is when the hotel allots its premises to host multiple events,…",4,w Dec 2016

I informed the guest services to remove, they confirmed but nothing happened. Next day, I have to again call the guest services and it was finally removed.

For the afternoon a very special spa treatment was organised for my wife. She had a superb time.   Finally, the evening ended at the Chambers, the private club. A special dinner was organised at the Chambers. I was given special permission even though I am not a member of the Chambers.   This is the Taj Hospitality.

The butler service was spot on and all the staff from the lounge where you could have breakfast, afternoon and evening cocktails could not do enough - they were so hospitable. What i liked as well is that the hotel gives you a feeling that you are able to wonder around a little and have a stroll on the boulevard, in other hotels as a single female traveler this is quite hard with all the security measures.

Few things I didn't find up to the level of the hotel are the quality of the service of the staff in the restaurants from the Buffet to the Chinese restaurant.  The price of the buffet was way too expensive for what you get and the lack of flexibility was not what I was expecting or used to in India.

1841,Prashanth,This is one of the best places to be in Mumbai. Its like where the land end. From the 20th floor it was peaceful and offered amazing views of the Arabian sea and also the BW sealink from the lobby. The access to Mantuga was a breeze. There was live music in the lobby with created just the atmosphere of easing stress during checking in and out. Whats more I had forgotten my shaver behind and the lost and found department couriered it back to me in Banaglore. Special thanks to Meena Bhatnagar for that.

The locker would not work, they actually had to replace the whole unit. We could not decrease the volume on the television as the lower limit was fixed at 14 and Max at 35. The staff had to bring the master remote and re program the TV so we could reduce the volume.  The staff were very responsive to our needs and addressed the issues, having said that you don't expect these issues when you stay at the Taj, it would be different if you are at Motel 6.

Checked in at around midnight and on the first night I didn't achieve any sleep because of mosquitos in my room. Called reception, told them about the problem and 15 min later I had two staff knocking on my door with an insect repellent cream and mosquito zapping racket. How was that going to solve the problem? Was I going to wait for them to find the insects? Certainly not at 05h o'clock in the morning. Insisted on changing rooms and finally was given a different room.

I stayed at land’s end, which is located at band stand, so that I can visit my mum who was admitted in hospice care for terminally sick cancer patients. I travelled from overseas, so it made sense to stay close by and visit her daily. I had emailed hotel reservation, prior to the travel stating the purpose of my visit. I had requested for quick and smooth check in, so that I can quickly rush to visit my mum.  Sarfraz & prajakta at reception, ensured it was rather a very quick check in, though I arrived earlier than check in time. (I was willing to keep my luggage and go off first).

The lobby is grand!  It is beautifully designed with Indian and British touches.  It is as if you have slipped back in time.  The room is massive and it is nicely decorated.  I believe most rooms, if not all, have a full or partial view of the ocean.  I was surprised with how quiet the room was and it provide a comfortable and restful time there.  There are many pillows to choose from and what is handy is that right by your bed is a control for everything in the room, including the drapes opening and closing.",5,Oct 2016

1874,RSE2,"The service at Taj hotels is always fabulous, and Lands End is no exception. We only ate breakfast in the hotel and it was largely as you would expect. The rooms are perfectly adequate but the decor is a little old fashioned for our tastes. It particularly shows up in no plugs or charging points near the beds for example. Of particular note was the shower which was incredibly powerful - dare I say almost too much so!  The hotel overlooks the Sea Link to Worli, and beyond that the evolving and rising skyline of Mumbai. It is close to most of the amenities of Bandra but due to the terrible traffic in Mumbai it can be a pain to get anywhere. Taj Lands End is a lovely hotel but I'm not sure I'd rush back to stay when next in Mumbai.",3,Oct 2016

Room was clean and staff attended to all my requests within minutes of calling Guest Services. The concierge even went a step further to have a last minute request for flowers delivered to my room on the house. Good restaurants and great location.

The location is good as the room was sea facing and it looks nice to sea orange-blue sky with the blend of sea color at the time of sunrise. Though the Bandra Worli seal link is behind the hotel but approach road is narrow which takes time to connect.  Had breakfast where spread was decent but quality was not up to the mark - sambhar was very spicy, muffins were very hard, not much option on salads. Dairy counter was good with variety of milk-based products - milkshakes, yoghurts, etc.  Room size was good but walls are not sound proof.

Everything is planned and well orchestrated by a staff of hundreds.  Rented a hotel car for the day to take a tour.  I could not imagine a more pleasant experience.  For the price, it was an excellent bargain.  I fully recommend the TAJ if you are staying in Mumbai.",5,w Aug 2016

1986,rammenon,"Its been many years since i stayed at Lands end. I have been gravitating to the newer hotels in the Worli area- offering shining interiors, cookie cutter service and burnished lobbies. Mumbai now has an embarrassment of choices- the newer ritzy hotels in Worli or the 5 - star cluster near the Airport.   The Lands end is an older property but still a great location. The location is excellent for quick commutes to city business district but quiet enough to come back at the end of a busy day. The rooms are well maintained and updated and the views are excellent,  rare in Mumbai and a welcome relief from staring at tenements or road traffic- the typical view from 5-star hotel rooms in Mumbai.   They have an excellent restaurant and Taj efficiency is apparent in the warmth and…",4,Aug 2016

Rooms were the best I have ever been to and compared to London's expensive and tatty hotels, this was amazing! Next time instead of resting in London, we will be flying straight to Mumbai and resting the Taj! The receptionist Gayatri was very charming and confident. Instantly made us feel at home.  Food is not the best and quite expensive, but there are so many food stalls outside! The views are to die for!",5,Aug 2016
1989,Kevin_Mumbai,Spent my birthday by checking in with my family for one night at the Taj Lands End. Did not receive even a murmur of a birthday wish let alone anything special for the day. That too after making it a point to put that into my booking reservation and after being a Taj InnerCircle Gold Tier member. Pathetic service experience as compared to what you come to experience as part of the Taj group.   Absolutely not worth the money spent on such an expensive property. Pretty disillusioned after this experience at the hotel. Passed the feedback as part of the survey they sent me. All I received was a couple of calls to apologize which doesn't change much now.  Is this the best you folks can do???,3,Aug 2016

As a 'long stay' visitor (2 weeks), they took my photo and so could greet me by my name as I got back ""home"" each evening.

1996,Curzongirl,"Absolutely shocked when I asked them to print out some business documents (colour) and was charged almost £150. Obscene when in London it would have cost £20 max. Felt they took advantage and were shamelessly ripping off tourists. When I complained they reduced it to £50. However not a good feeling to stay in a Hotel and always have to watch prices for fear of being taken for a ride. Rooms were tired and dated. Spa was good, but again not good value. I dont mind paying high prices but for value items that justify the price hike. I will NOT be staying at this hotel again.",1,Aug 2016

Coming to food and hygiene,unlike other 5 star hotels which serve relatively bland food,this hotel is unique. We relished the tasty dishes both veg n non veg, the desserts and one tasty dish I can remember is Dahi Bhalla which was simply amazing.

A good cup of tea or coffee after breakfast to get you going.   Though only the Taj Gateway in Bangalore surpasses all in coffee, the Lands End has absolutely everything else, and the view of the Arabian sea.

Lovely setting with excellent service and to top it off the draught beer was cold and effervescent. Lovely. Offered some snacks but declined.

The breakfast was large and covered pretty much everything from gluten free bread to South Indian dosas, eggs to order etc.  I just must mention that I found the lobby very very crowded and not too restful. Ditto the coffee shop for breakfast. In fact every restaurant seemed overbooked. Good for them, but not too peaceful if you're looking for some peace and quiet, even at the bar.  Pool, gym pretty good for those wanting to use them.  The staff all around…",3,Jul 2016
2059,Vinay,Tal LandEnd is a very good hotel located on the sea shore. View is nice and the service exceptionally good. Breakfast has a good spread and tastes well. The rooms are also nice but are getting old and they need renovation or repairs.,5,w Jul 2016
2060,Anshuman,"Feels great to be treated royally. Everything is just perfect. The breakfast is just overwhelming. Don't miss it for anything. Loved my platter. Over all amazing experience. The view from my room was splendid. The staff was courteous. The ambience was beautiful. I would love to come back here again. It is centrally located which means you can get out to shopping streets and work places within a stone's throw. The best part is that it is only 20 minutes from the airport. If you are checking out in the morning then the same ride would take you only 15 minutes. There are many cabs waiting outside the Taj incase you don't want to use the Hotel cab which by the way is expensive. You are living right next to Shah Rukh Khan, Salman Khan, John Abraham, Rekha etc... what else would you…",5,w Jul 2016

2067,Chetna23,"The only good thing about this hotel was the service given by the staff. Sofas curtains bedrest were extremely torn out, stained. You can see a layer of dirt on the day curtains and other upholstery items. Would not recommend anyone to stay there if you are someone who has a thing for clean things. 12k including taxes for a room like this is crazy. I would have paid around 4-5 k only for a room like this. ",2,Jul 2016

This is one of the prime properties in Mumbai and the hotel does not disappoint. Service was amazing and personalized. I had the privilege of visiting a club room suite as well. The view from there (Bandra Sea Link) was just gorgeous. There is always an overabundance of facilities and amenities at this hotel. The lobby is noteworthy due to its design.   One disappointment for me personally was the room service was not good at all. Small quantities of overpriced food. At that price level i expect gourmet food. But all i got was cold, under or overcooked food lacking basic seasoning or taste. We had to eat due to hunger but i would suggest that guests go…",4,Jul 2016

We start from the door with NAMASTE, the welcome drink, welcome blessing with Tilak (the red dot on the forehead) and a Flower Garlands. This is India welcoming tradition.  I was given a room first where I could smell the fungus in it, I requested another room they immediately accommodated my request.  The restaurants are awesome very nice food of course on the higher range of price, but nice and delicious. Breakfast is meeting anybody’s and everybody’s taste.

The view from the rooms is beautiful and no matter which side you're facing you get a good sea view. The Indian restaurant Masala bay serves excellent north Indian cuisine. The poolside takes you away from the city giving you a resort feel. Overall a very good place to stay for business & pleasure. ",5,w Jul 2016

This hotel has an amazing lobby and lobby bar which is open 24 hours and is one of my favorite place to sip a drink in the night while reading a book or working on my computer or just watch the film stars dropping by. The Indian Restaurant serve very good and wide variety of some of the Indian classic dishes.   It also has a Chinese and an Italian restaurant.  You step out of the hotel and you re bang on the famous band stand  and you walk on the bandstand and see the homes of some of the popular Indian film stars.   As this place is in Bandra home to some of the best restaurants in Mumbai you are…,5,Jul 2016
2086,Raaja,Dinner served at their Restaurant - Vista is pathetic. Better eat outside than in the Hotel at Night.  Breakfast is also good. Otherwise I like this Hotel and would recommend to stay. Just don't eat dinner at Vista. The location is very good and service is very good.,4,w Jul 2016
2087,Praveen,"Very elegant property, ideally located in Bandra bandstand, easy to get around from-to Airport and mid-town. The variety and selections of restaurants (Indian, Chinese and Italian) on-site are very good. Although we ended up using the buffets at Vista, the spread was very well planned and offered us the Indian and western menus we liked. Particularly liked the 'cutting tea' was a very nice touch for breakfast. The staff is very friendly and was immediately responsive to our service requests.",5,w Jul 2016
2088,Ram,"If you want to experience service at its best on the land ... you must visit this end !  From the moment you arrive , to the moment you leave the Taj will always take care you like a baby . Its personalization at its best . From listening to your needs to wanting to hear for your needs is a big shift and Taj demonstrates this to perfection. Jiaan the restaurant manager at Vista , Rakesh and Sujay , Chandrakant to Divyveer .to Shivi at checkout there are many rockstars at Taj ... But the reason that Taj is what it is because of the culture and leadership from the legendary icon himself  Mr. Ratan Tata who so kindly agreed to take a snap with my son a humbling moment ... Taj you continue to surprise me everytime I stay , May you always shine",5, a review Jul 2016

I had called the hotel to make a reservation and Mr Yohann Billimoria was more than helpful to help us with the rates and offers. He also explained the various room categories. We were staying in the Taj Club Room and the view was clear sea facing. Though I think the Sea Link view is much better from the room. The rooms are huge and quite comfortable  The staff is polite and helpful. The breakfast spread in Vistaa is quite extensive but since we were staying on a weekend, I believe the staff was too busy. There is lack of Personal attention as such.  Overall the stay was nice and comfortable.",4,w Jun 2016

Loved every minute within my 5 minutes of arrival. I was offered a drink and opted for Masela tea which arrived within minutes - tray was impeccable and aroma and crunchy biscuits made my jet leg disappear. The concierge desk was very knowledgeable about the city and things to do. The variety of restaurants leaves one with lots of options. Great location in Bandra.

I have visited the Indian restaurant and the main restaurant where you can choose between a la carte and buffet. Both were very enjoyable as for the food and the atmosphere. I enjoyed the location. It is close to the airport and close to the main road and sealink bridge which gives a fairly good commute to the southern part of the city. The area north of the hotel (Bandra) is fairly posh and seems totally safe to walk around (there is a nice pedestrian promenade along the coast). Just outside the hotel is an old fort which gives a nice view on the bay and sealink bridge. Mumbai can be quite overwhelming…",5,Jun 2016

The staff was so nice from the second I walked in the door and they greeted me with a flower necklace. Everyday fresh flowers in my room. Flower petals decorating the entry way. And this was not only left in my room because I was an organizer. I confirmed with other delegates, and they, too, got the floral treatments! The clientele is also very smart and sophisticated. This is a great place to come to at the end of the day and get your work done.  You'll be happy you stayed here.",5,Jun 2016

Great team from the very start to leaving - insofar it was my first trip to India they helped us organize the sightseeing tour around Mumbai, to book a taxi to the airport and all the other facilities were in time and at the first request. Excellent breakfasts!!!! Even better than in many 5-star european hotels - besides you may choose cuisine, many dishes are prepared right there as you watch. There are also many other restaurants. Perfect choice for a first stay in Mumbai.",5,Jun 2016
2122,RPM59,"My stay at this Taj hotel was enjoyable even by the usual high standards of Taj hotels.  Location along the seafront, with every room facing the sea, is a definite plus.  Proximity to the airport and the new business areas (but slightly distant from the old business and tourist areas of South Bombay) for this trip, mattered.  My standard room was modern, neat and well appointed.  The wifi was reliable and strong.  Service throughout the hotel is personal and efficient.  As a small example, a one-page print and scan in the business centre was done for me gratis.  The restaurants and other hotel facilities are well above average.  All in all, a fine destination to stay at in Mumbai.",5,Jun 2016

Right from the security to the various departments that a guest comes in contact the behaviour is genuine affectionate.

2133,AmolDivekar,The location of this place takes the cake.  Sea View on one side and Bandra Worli Sealink on the other. So you either get to view the Sunrise or the Sunset.  The Hotel well it's Taj so you cannot expect any mistakes or flaws. That's how it is. Really nice place with good ambience at the lobby but I just feel it looks a little worn out and outdated design wise. ( Only the Lobby)   The Rooms are nice and big with the necessities. The best part of this place is the shower area with a lavish Bath tub and huge vestibule. Nice clean and impeccable rooms and hospitality. The breakfast served is also nice but just once place where I feel they can improve in terms of taste. I would still rate it 7/10 but it can be better. May be that's asking too much.   Try the Chinese restaurant Ming…,5,Jun 2016

If you are on a business trip and want to feel home then you should stay here. the staff's are very curtious and they have a big smile .  Good balance in the spread. I think it's a bench mark for Taj service quality,5,Jun 2016
2138,Aditya,It is a great experience to come to the hotel every time. The hospitality given by Naresh Chavan makes it an amazing experience. Keep up the good work.

It proved a memorable experience and not just because of its an excellent location but because whilst the property doesn't look out of the ordinary from the exterior, it is a surprise package from the moment one enters! It has been refurbished to a high standard with no shortage of facilities (6 Restaurants - including Vista on the 2nd Floor which puts on one of the best buffet breakfasts I have experienced for a while, nice grounds, excellent swimming pool etc).

2151,ridwaanm,We loved our stay at this fabulous hotel. The rooms were big & comfortable with fantastic bathroom. Breakfast was good as well. We spent time each day walking the grounds with a gorgeous pool and beautiful views across the city. Staff are outstanding. Room service went out of their way to have a packet of cigarettes delivered at 11:30pm as I had left mine behind  in a taxi. Concierge even had the handles on our luggage repaired and placed in our room within 5 hours of arrival.  Famous Bollywood actors live around the corner and a few stars can be seen in the hotel restaurants.  ,5,Jun 2016
2152,Princejaipur,Taj Lands End : This is a wonderful property in BANDRA WEST. My experience with Lands End has been very good. The staff at the hotel makes you feel welcome all the time and they put in extra yards to make sure your stay is comfortable and you looked after .  Zubeda at the front desk makes sure your check in is smooth. On my next visit she made sure i get the same room i stayed in earlier and that too me is very important as a guest. I feel welcomed and cared for. She is what makes your first impression and welcome at the hotel wonderful.  I would like to come and stay here again .  Thanks everyone.,4,Jun 2016

Its an old hotel so maybe thats why all the furniture felt old. Lobby area and the corridors on floors too felt old and a bit of old dusty smell. But overall excellent hotel.  Note : take the sea facing rooms. Totally worth it,5,Jun 2016
2154,Sudhir,I had been on a business trip to Mumbai and stayed at this hotel. The hotel is a pleasure to stay and caters to all your requirements.

Right from the traditional welcome owing to a local festival to the very pleasant staff at check-in who gave us a room with an excellent view to the incredibly thoughtful service, this indeed is a Taj Luxury property.

Overall, we really enjoyed our stay there and the memories are very pleasant.",5,Jun 2016

If you choose to take a regular room where your check in and out is at the lobby your waisting your money.  The TAJ group of hotel are ones i always stay in with no complaints. However this time around I was well impressed wit the service of the executive floor, the food, the laundry, the room, tidiness and hygiene was top but the staff at the lobby check in and out counter were rude, unforfestional and need training.",5,w Jun 2016

2164,202vineetb,"Taj Lands End is a sparkling example of the legacy of Taj Hotels. It stands tall at the end of a rocky landmass (hence the name) and overlooks tony Bandra on one side and the Arabian sea on the other. In short, its a beautiful hotel you cant go wrong with.  The rooms are nicely done and I always got a view of the sea. The bathrooms are large with an old-world feel to them. The in-room dining menu is very exciting. Don't miss the lobster. I also enjoyed an African mutton dish when I was there - as an African food-festival of sorts was underway.  The lobby and the lobby bar are somewhat in need of refurbishing. The only disappointment was the club lounge that looks like an old canteen.   All in all - a hotel that will not let you down. Go for it without any hesitation.",5,Jun 2016

There were quite a few people and there should have been a hotel sat ff managing all the guests especially when there was a waiting for about 20-25 minutes for people to check in/out.

What delighted me at the end of my stay just before checking out was the location of the sea facing breakfast spread.  Been tired of staying in hotel properties surrounded by glass & concrete - the lands end offers unadulterated charm of Bombay with the balmy sea air hitting you.  Not to forget the best in class service standards in hospitality which Taj group stands tall for!  Will surely visit again!,5,May 2016

This trip I stayed at the Taj Lands end for around 15 days..  The Breakfast service is excellent, the buffet has small changes in the menu everyday so people like me who are staying there for long don't have to look at the same menu everyday. Never had to wait for a table even in the most crowded hours. Staff has always been courteous and friendly.  My room was sea facing never had any problems with that, room service was quick and most of the orders were delivered ahead of the time promised. Prompt service for clearance as well.

2214,johnaN7643AD,"Having enjoyed a 6 night superb stay at Taj Palace Delhi, the next 5 nights at the Taj Lands End were resoundingly mediocre. No big disasters just a series of small niggles which caused frustration such as a huge deposit being charged to my Amex card (rather than preauthorised), no toiletries in the room one day, dire internet. The exception was the Indian Restaurant Masala Bay which was better than excellent food, service and ambience.",3,May 2016

One of the few places where the staff had genuine and not plastic smiles, they striked a pleasant conversation with you etc. The room was well kempt and the location too is fantastic. The only grudge i have was the breakfast buffet which paled in comparison to those by trident, rennaisance and other hotels in this league. Limited choices for vegans and overall variety and quality of food were simply uncomparable to other premier hotels in mumbai. The only reasons I gave this hotel a 4 star and not a 5 was the food and the pathetically slow wi-fi.",4,w May 2016

Rooms are large and spacious and many have excellent views of the sea / city. Rooms look a little tired and could very well use some sprucing up. What I would however ask the management to do immediately is to remove the bizarre red color tube light which is installed diagonally across from the bed, I imagine as a 'night light'. For starters, it is the same height as the bed - so basically when I was trying to sleep the light was in my face!   Bathrooms are spacious but once again the fittings seem really really old.

Entering the hotel feels like I've stepped back in time during the days of the Maharajas.   However, now, it looks old and tired in need of refurbishment. Located next to the grey sea, I don't think the sky was ever blue whenever  I stayed in this hotel. The best, as is in all Taj hotel that I've ever stayed in, is their laundry services and the staff.  My clothes always turned out superbly pressed and crisps and staff were always courteous.

Well, I strongly believe that Taj Exotica, Goa is one of the world's best hotels (if not the best), and in the same breath, I have no hesitation in stating that this is one of the worst Taj properties I've ever stayed in. This is certainly no 5 Star experience.   The property is in dire need of a thorough renovation (much like its cousin, Taj Vivanta Cuffe Parade). Both rooms that I stayed in were extremely noisy. I could hear water gushing through the wall plumbing, footsteps outside and tapping from adjacent rooms. On my first stay, I was up from 2.30-6am. At 4am, I had to ask for ear plugs and despite the swimming ear plugs provided, I did not get any sleep. I…",1,May 2016

Delay in repair, not offering another room and the repair not being effective as in I had to sleep the night with open curtains and switched on light was unacceptable. The Duty Manager was not available to attend to my call to try and expedite resolution of the problem appeared unusual.  Queue at breakfast to be seated resulted in no breakfast on a otherwise packed business day.",1, review Apr 2016

Imagine the taj website states 11.5 grands but when i booked using the coupon they told me il be able to book at rack rate of 28 grands so any layman can understand this is purely ponzy scheme wat Taj is trying to sell and not only restricted to taj lands entire chain of hotel is doing this they never let me use any of my coupon stating rooms are unavailable or can't be used at a given time if you never intended to give us the benefit why the hell you sold this voucher for???

They weren't able to give us another room since the hotel was booked out over the weekend due to 2 weddings. That was very disappointing but they made sure that we got moved the next day. The room wasn't ready by the time we came back to the hotel the next day but at least they paid for a drink at the hotel bar while we were waiting. There was nothing to complain about, when it came to the food, room service, cleanliness or helpfulness of the Taj staff.

The check in took very long, guess it was over sold. We got upgraded to an ocean view room however that was with our vouchers. The usual turn down service didn’t happen – we had to request. Something you dont expect to happen at the Taj ! We had a great stay at this property, however feel that service standards had dropped, again probably it was oversold  The breakfast spread is super and a must have for all.

Took much more time than usual in the check in procedure , though we'd arrived at 1530 hrs. , which is way beyond the usual Checkin time of 1400 hrs. !!! Also my earlier request of late check out on a sunday was not well honoured !!! i usually get an upgrade to The club Taj Room using my upgrade vouchers , but that also wasn't given to me this time ( and even last time that I remember ) !!!

The room also had bad sound proofing, so I could hear the water and the flush in the next door room.  I had to make three request spread over 40 minutes to get my ""luxury"" room changed!   On two occasions, I requested for almonds to be soaked overnight as I am on a particular diet. However, despite being told that these had been soaked , on each occasion, I was given blanched almonds. One doesn't have to be a Michelin star chef to know the difference.   Is this what luxury at Taj has come to mean? Rather unfortunate, as I expect a lot better from Taj.

It needs a serious facelift.

However the shower cabinet did not drain well and would get clogged to almost ankle deep water after every shower which was a major downer. The restaurants are great with some really lovely food and drinks.

The service was generally top notch, however, some areas should be improved to provide a 5 star experience.  First, the luggage goes through a security area prior to being taken by the bell staff.  When I asked to have my luggage, the bell staff refused to turn it over, insisting that I allow him to bring it to the room.  This is not appropriate behavior for a bell staff.

We ordered room service and the food was awesome with the paneer tikka wrap being my favourite.   Tried the street food that they had every day from 4-8pm. Was totally disappointed with the vada pav.

There were couples, and also families with children. The service was very good! The food did not take long to come at all consdering there was 12 of us, and I cannot fault one dish we ordered. The food was hot when it came with such flavour and great taste, I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for really tasty Chinese food.

Maybe a bit too modern as I could not locate the master light switch next to the bed and had to walk all the way to the main door to switch off (this can be made better). Also, access to hot water in the bath was try and error (can be made better). But even these things can't take away the real luxury 5 star feel to this property. And yeah - what crowd!

During check-in, the lady did not sound very friendly and did not answer some of the queries we had or the answers were vague. During check-out, the print out of the invoice was taken 3 times before they got it right. I expected a much smoother experience…",4,Feb 2016

The rooms had the view over the pool and looking directly over the bridge link, the bay and the new growing financial district area. We took the 2 armchairs and turned them around to just look out the window, legs up on the window sill,  and watch the fantastic view whilst having coffee or beers and listening to the Indian music channels on the tv - it was fantastic. The service was faultless and there was big attention to detail, very impressed with the staff there.

2430,sidnet,"Very few hotels in the world can boast of this one feature -- every single room has a sea view. Such is the location of this property. Barring the few properties on the Marine Drive, which are opulent and well appointed, there is none better than this, overlooking the Bandra-Worli Sea Link.   I cant remember any element of my stay on multiple occasions, that was not unequivocally luxurious, be it the decor of the room or the breakfast spread. Yes, the pricing is slightly expensive and they seldom open up to discounts, but having said that, if one can afford the price tag, Land's End is a property to die for!",5,Feb 2016
2431,Alexander,"I stayed here for 4 nights last month. we had a very special time. The hotel was tidy, well run, and my room was spacious clean and comfortable. The bathroom had masses of hot water and a powerful shower- so important and such a rarity these days in India.  Breakfast was expansive delicious and a huge range of different dishes. I ate in San Lorenzo where i had a good Italian meal, and also at the buffet where i had an unexpectedly moist and elicits portion of roast turkey.  Sitting by the pool with a beer was a delight, such a shame that the pollution is so bad that the view is spoilt whilst looking out to sea.",5,w Feb 2016

I arrived at 3.30am and was offered a cup of camomile tea to be sent to my room (no extra charge). Everything I needed, the staff were on hand to help with. I would highly recommend this hotel. Since I was on a business trip, I'm not even sure how accessible it is to other areas of Mumbai but I was there to attend a conference and from that point of view, it was fabulous!",5,w Feb 2016
2433,Smittenfood,Love this hotel! Easily one of my favorite places to stay in bombay. The view is fantastic if you ask for a sea facing room as high up a floor as available!

The food choices fantastic and great especially for a first visit to india! ,5,Feb 2016

2438,Cornell_Hotelie_94,"This hotel could be much more and should be given the price.   The property is dated especially when compared with international chains and recently opened properties in Mumbai.   One way to offset age is to improve service, but sadly Taj service is very reactionary rather than proactive in anticipating guest needs.   Check in and check out were ok with minimal hassle.   A bottle of lotion was on my bed on reaching the room.  Strange and honestly unnecessary.   To offset the lack of international plugs in the room, there was a power strip on the nightstand.  The lobby lounge menu needs an upgrade to a proper mix of Indian snacks and International fare.   The breakfast buffet was better although getting a dosa to the table was quite a challenge.  I also had issues trying to find…",3,Feb 2016

2442,Susan,"From the flower necklace presented at check in to the kind helpfulness with an early morning departure, the Taj Lands End exceeded expectations. It's located in a swanky neighborhood where nice eateries are within a short taxi or tuk tuk ride (or even walkable), but it's hard to leave. The breakfast buffet was surprisingly high quality with lots of variety - fruit, cereal, bread, omelettes made to order, Indian dishes, American style breakfast (hashbrowns!).  Really a treat for a business conference stay.",5,w Feb 2016
2443,Lovneesh,A nice Taj experience in Mumbai. The check in was smooth though the lobby was really crowded as it was the Valentine's day. The room was nice too with cool ambience. Preferred to go to the pool side restaurant for a drink and dinner. That turned out to be a let down though. It was full and getting closed by the time I reached. There were just two servers there and took a long time for us to be served. Morning breakfast was very nice and the restaurant staff was able to handle the big crowd of people very efficiently.  The checkout was smooth too. Overall a very nice stay.,5,Feb 2016

The hotel was extremely accommodating of our requests, they decorated the room with beautiful flowers and chocolates and served us an excellent Brunch in-room.   I recommend the Taj Club Room since they are recently renovated and come with the latest fittings, it also includes access to the club lounge where you can enjoy breakfast or the evening cocktail hour.   Additionally, since I am from Mumbai I can add the following notes for people looking at this property.   - Centrally located in the city, easy to get to from the Airport and the city as well, however Mumbai traffic is very unpredictable and a 20 min drive can easily stretch…",5,Feb 2016

From the checkin to checkout, Taj accorded my guests dignity & luxury so very missing now in many large hotels. Couple of families got upgraded to the Club Rooms, which have subdued colors and a private breakfast lounge. The rest of the rooms in lower floors were equally good. With 9 rooms to inspect, I was pleasantly surprised how impeccable everyone of them were.

After some wait we were given keys our room. It mentioned room was on 12th floor. However it actually was on 2nd floor. This is word of caution for fellow travellers, check which floor you are being alloted. We were actually expecting higher floor. To have better view of sea.

Each person is treated as an individual and made to feel special by absolutely everybody from Security and Gardner to Chef and Manager . All the positive comments are true and can't be added to. I was somewhat busy during my visit so did not visit the gardens or the pool which looked so inviting from my room every day but I know the level of service wouldn't have wavered. Again I did not visit any of the…,5, review Jan 2016

I always want to come back.,5,w Dec 2015

2577,Rahul,"I came here for my honeymoon and it was a fabulous experience at the Taj Land's End. Located at possibly one of best suburbs in Mumbai, the moonlit Sea View from the rooms is the icing on the cake.  The room comfort is good, however the automatic room air conditioning always ensures the room is too chilled for comfort when you are outside. The bathroom facilities are also good. The service is a tad slow at times, but the staff is very courteous.  The breakfast spread is lavish with a large section devoted towards healthy food. The food at Min Yang and Masalabay is excellent, while the 24 hour dining at Vista is alright.  I would highly recommend this hotel for those looking for a great romantic stay in Mumbai.",5,review Dec 2015

However, I was not able to understand all buttons for the electronic toilet seat. How to switch off the heating? I also did not understand all the options for the bathtub.

While the front desk was generous enough to give us a considerably early check-in and a standard late check-out deal, we faced several issues. About the room: TV in room malfunctioned twice; some of the switches/controls didn't work; shower was an absolute disaster and an ergonomic nightmare; paint peeling off near the toilet floor About the service: We went to this Italian restaurant in the hotel where the food was fantastic but service gaffes marred a nice evening -- they brought our food to the bar though we asked to be seated at a table when one was free.

We'd like to single out in particular, Mr Jazib Hussain who did everything he could to make us feel at home.

Had the pleasure of using the JIVA Spa - the experience was excellent and will definitely return to on a future visit. The in-room dining service and willingness of staff to even deliver multiple ice buckets and glasses all night with a smile makes the Taj training stand out.

Dinner at their Indian restaurant mirrored the good experience, although the Chinese restaurant (our first choice) was not available for hours due to heavy rush.

He inspired me to try amazing breakfast delicacies including a local speciality egg in a light creamy curry sauce and arranged for a breakfast bag for an early airport departure. Rooms on the 25th floor are incredible, soaring views with swooping kites and beautiful bathrooms all completely ultra modern amazing. The pool is great and as its Mumbai, nice and warm. I love this place. Can't wait to return on Thursday!",5,Nov 2015

Lobby was very imposing and vast open area at the lobby makes you to feel and enjoy the ambiance.....Though we have booked premium Sea View room, while checking in....upgraded to Club Level. Great Experience. Definitely I would like to recommend this property to some of my friends. Breakfast spread was quite substantial. We have enjoyed the spread. I have travelled with my colleague from our office, we both were there to attend the seminar held in the same property. He too enjoyed staying here at Taj.

2648,kapurash,"Visited the Taj Lands End for a function some time back.  The hotel exudes a charm of its own and continues to excite every time one is here. Previously known as the Regent, this hotel was subsequently taken over by the Taj Group who have taken up the property several notches and made it into one of the best hotels in North Mumbai.  The food served and service at the restaurants is top class. The banquet hall is reasonably spacious and so are the gardens outside.   Preferred by both business and leisure travellers alike.",4,Nov 2015

It's a Beautiful hotel, just  impeccable. The lobby ambience is amazing. Rooms were very clean and spacious and cleaned everyday.  View was lovely from the high floors. The bathroom was even better with all amenities. Staff is very courteous and friendly.  Housekeeping staff are very trusting and loyal. Our baggage was over weight and we wanted to get rid of some items and decided to give it to the housekeeping staff but they would not accept anything unless we wrote a official letter listing the items and informed the front desk.

2650,Gearhead85,"The Taj Land's End is a classic elegant hotel with Indian style and charm.  As an older hotel, the rooms are large, clean, and well maintained.  I also love the location.  It is right by the ocean so many rooms have ocean views.  It is about 20 minutes from the airport and also 20 minutes from the BKC financial district as well as being right by the entrance to the ""sea way"" highway to down town Mumbai.  The neighborhood is a residential area for Bollywood stars which adds to the flavor of the stay.  The gym is large with a good selection of machines and weights.  the pool area is nice but the pool is not really suited for swimming laps.

The rooms are good the renovated one i was put up was quite fancy, the upholstery is subtle with the colours matched professionally by a high end designers, (I say this because many other hotels are designed by really filthy local designers ) What is most striking and top of the line ; a taj thing is implacable service a kind of super personal behaviour demonstrated by the staff. It's in the DNA of every taj property which no other hotel company in the world including the Marriott can ever match.

Location depends on the purpose of your visit to Bombay, but in all cases it is situated centrally and has convenient approach.  Rooms are in excellent condition, spacious and with all amenities. Have a grand lobby, staff are much helpful and courteous. Best part is the view from rooms, overlooking the Bandra Sea link.  Restaurant provides a wide variety of menu, food is good but will not say that it was excellent. But of course the desserts are excellent. Would definitely advise stay here if you have the budget!!",5,Nov 2015

It has its class and touch of luxury across every location inside the hotel that will make you feel that good and special .  The finest Chinese cuisine at Ming Yang is something nobody should miss while in Mumbai and the best location to sit and just gape and gape around by sipping some of the finest Coffee from COORG and few delicious snacks at Atrium is something worth it .",5, review Nov 2015

The views from this hotel especially the ones overlooking the sea link bridge is unbelievable - no wonder is being rated one of the top 10 downtown views of the world..  Hotel has everything that you need for a city holiday stay. all the three restaurants are fabulous. if you want a cheaper fare - you can take a cab (easily available) at the hotel  and go to Bandra.  Staff is amazingly courteous and genuinely helpful,5,w Nov 2015

In October this year, i stayed at the Taj as it was close to my meeting place. The rooms have been upgraded, which was earlier a concern.  Service, as usual was excellent. Breakfast it pretty good, but i have seen better at other competing hotels. View from the direct sea view rooms is excellent.   The main grudge : Elevators are very slow. They take a long time to come. Very frustrating if you are in a hurry.",4,Nov 2015

Breakfast buffet is extensive, and the Malabar Indian restaurant is superb. Room service is speedy. I could leave for breakfast, mark the room to be cleaned, and find everything done on my return - every day. The pool is little-used and has a separate area for children.

Not only was it a beautiful hotel, service was also excellent. I received a warm, local welcome at the check-in counter and had a pretty garland put around my neck before the check-in process started.  The room was spacious with a beautiful bathroom equipped with both shower and bathtub facilities, and also provided a fantastic view of the sea.  It was also the Alphonso mango season during my stay, and delicious mangoes  were served at the hotel restaurants.

It would not be an exaggeration to say this is one of the finest Taj properties I have said.Situated in Bandra ,it's rightly named lands end..because post it is the sea. The room I had got offered breathtaking view to the sea link and the sea. The rooms are spacious and the food is great !  However most interesting is the next day put on the jogging shoes and jog past Mannat, SRK's house and the Galaxy Apartment. To catch up with Saleem Chacha Salman's Dad ,you don't need to be lucky.And if you are lucky one you might catch a glimpse of the Salman Khan.

A good spread for breakfast and was thankfully not crowded. A mention for Rajib at the Front Desk for checking on us regularly.

Hence, during my last visit to Mumbai on 17th/18th May, 2015 I once again stayed here and found the experience as fascinating as always. There is a dignified elegance about the hotel which lends grace and charm to the place. The hotel is located in Bandra which is bubbling with energy yet the location is as serene as one can hope for in Mumbai. From the rooms one gets a lovely view of the sea and the SeaLink expressway. Somehow I always find a rather purposeful atmosphere and a sense of efficiency prevalent in the hotel which is an excellent abode for business travellers and an ideal venue for offsite meetings and conferences. The food is typically Taj and the breakfast and luncheon buffet spreads are awesome. The…",5,Oct 2015

2720,Louis,Our stay was an excellent one . The care and courtesies extend at every level was par one amily . The only draw back was that the rates could have been bettered for some one who has visited the hotel for the first time and travelling with family two of whom were senior citizens who worked for Air India for many years and supported Taj to the hilt .... ...

I had come a week early and was met with a very lukewarm reception from the duty manager.  She listed off the restaurants and sent me on my way.  Through sheer tenacity I figured out what to do.  Check-in is a process and lengthy.  We sat, then were asked to move up to the desk only to then have someone else ""cut"" and sit down and then we were asked to be re-seated.  The restaurant that evening had strict rules on decorating our table so that was not an option.  Upon check-out I was given a message that they had to re-copy our passports.

The location, facilities, view etc are all fine but the differentiating factor between a good hotel and a great hotel is the service and attention - and they were nowhere to be seen at Taj.

Has a beautiful large pool with kids pool as well. Rooms are quiet large, probably the largest among the top ten hotels in Mumbai. The ambience was excellent and the service too was at par. As its located about mid way between the air port and South Mumbai, getting around was convenient. We had booked almost a month in advance and were able to get a good bargain.

The only advantage of its location, the promenade in front, will occupy only a few minutes of your attention.  If you are a gadget user, you'll find their WiFi setup frustrating.

This is my 5th visit to Taj Lands end and I will come back.  Taj Land End has fantastic sea views and is very centrally located. The rooms are very comfortable and luxurious. The poolside is awesome for adults and children all alike. All the restaurants serve various delicious cuisines, Ming Yang being my favourite.",5,Sep 2015
2784,SinghCzar,Was here for a Business related event that we hosted. Trully a great place with efficient and helpful staff.

2786,Akshat,We stayed in club rooms and found the property to be just amazing. Service standards - awesome. All the staff smiles and serves you. Food we ordered for room service and breakfast was pretty good. Breakfast spread could have been wider. Rooms with the view of Bandra (Band Stand). The other side of the rooms have a view of Bandra Sea Link - that is also quite good. All in all. One of the very good 5 star property I have stayed in.,5,w Sep 2015
2787,Peter,"Stayed at the hotel to attend a Conference. Excellent amenities, extremely friendly personnel, efficient and quick check-in and out, and a super location. Guests feel welcome and valued.

2789,hjnicols,"Location, location, location, almost every room has an excellent window view of the sea.  Busy Mumbai is in walking distance or an easy rickshaw / cab ride away.  Security is excellent and of course the Taj is the Taj.  Do spend some time sitting in the lobby bar listening to the wonderfully soothing piano music and when you do introduce yourself to your serving staff.  Assistant Manager Naresh and barmen Vasudeo and Sandesh Called me by name each evening when I arrived.  Tell them that Hank sent you!",5,Sep 2015
2790,Anosh,"We have been staying regularly at most Taj Hotels in India since the past many years and always find the 'Taj ' hospitality much superior to other hotels.  In fact Taj Tashi -Bhutan was by far the best!!!!! However this time it seems to be a bit of a let down, right from check in, to room service,  to room amenities. Has the service and warmth diminished??? I hope not! Reception and cashier need to coordinate much better and deals must be clearly mentioned to avoid and dissapointment. We were told that we can have  free access to the club lounge along with our family members using it, but were shocked to receive an absurd amount to the bill for drinks and snacks. Pls be clear when you check in. A smile was rarely seen on the staff this visit.  ",3,w Sep 2015

2797,Budour66,"Lovely sea view from the room, however, although they mention sea view but not all the rooms have full sea view you might be looking into houses next to the hotel with very little sea view. We booked 5 rooms and not all of us got what we booked, some of us got lower category rooms. Most of the floors don't have any interconnected rooms specially the higher category rooms have NO interconnected rooms at all although they don't mention it when you ask.  It is misleading, they say interconnected rooms are subject to availability but when you reach they say we don't have any rooms for this category, this is what happened with us. Food is terrible in the bar area.  Great lobby.    Breakfast is really good with lots of veriety  location is far from everything. If you are a tourist you…",4,Sep 2015

So asked the Hotel Car to excuse me since another vehicle was waiting for me. My arrival to the Hotel got delayed. Missed the traditional Taj reception. The Service has however gone done since my previous visit. It took over an hour for the In Room Dinning order to be delivered. As requested, was waiting for the room to be cleared.  I was about to fall asleep. However, the butler sent someone to clean the room instead.",4, review Sep 2015

There are plenty of eating options within the facility right from continental to indian food which makes it really exciting.",4,Sep 2015

Doormen were ambassador of the property, who recieved and seen-off us well.  Room Service person who brought us welcome drink in room served us with a smile.

Highly Recommended to travel community.",5, review Sep 2015
2807,ADash29,"While on transit through Mumbai, I wanted stay some where near the airport and nothing could be better than Taj Lands End, where I stayed for the first time. I am back again with them as I was impressed with their courtesy and service. The location is excellent even if you want to get to the happening South Mumbai due to the sea link. Great place to go for an early morning walk or jog along the shore, a mini marine drive I can say. I have stayed even in hotels in marine drive and this was nothing less.",5,Sep 2015

Right from the time we reached till the time we checked out , it was awesome. The check in process, the rooms, view from the rooms , Bathroom fittings, quality of amenities was top notch. Loved the dance program organised for kids with yummy snacks for the little ones. I must admit it was really a WAH !! TAJ experience.",5,w Sep 2015

What do you mean you can't find it? It was there! I know exactly where I put it and I did not move it at all.  FINE. I was catching a plane, didn't have enough time to argue with them on this. So I decided I will deal with them again later, I wrote them an email after I landed. I gave them very specific information, hopefully they could realized that there is only two reason they couldn't find my watch (1) they didn't check it throughly; (2) someone took my watch.  I am not in India anymore so there isn't much I could do, my coworker helped me to talk to the staff as she is in Mumbai.…",1,Sep 2015

At Taj Lands End, if you are staying in a room on upper floors and facing west side then you can experience this blissful sunset with vast Ossian with reflecting beauty of Setteing Sun on the calm water. And complete silence ...... You can make such evening romantic or spiritual , it's up to you......

2826,Barry,"Stepping into the Taj is quite surreal given the hassle and bustle that is the manic city of Mumbai. Really secure environment although the level of security can be a little disconcerting or comforting depending on how perceive the vibrant life of the city.  Located by the sea in what feels like a bit more upmarket part of town, it is certainly not down town. If you want to go downtown it is no more than a quick taxi ride away. Found it to be a good base location for my trip.  The interior of the hotel is finished and maintained to very high standards and there is nice outdoor pool and bar area.   Staff were very attentive, courteous and efficient, couldn't have asked for more",5,w Sep 2015
2827,Sanaya,This was one of my best stays there than my previous ones. I see a lot of friendly and smiling staff every time ready to help you out and serve you.

Many times I have visited this hotel alone also and I mark it as a safe hotel for lady travelers too.,5,rote a review Sep 2015

A bit out of the way - an hour drive to Colaba Market, 10 minutes drive to the closest shopping - but I was able to hear crashing waves at night and woke up to dogs barking at sunrise.  The grounds are well manicured, and the gym is very nice and well-equipped.  I'd stay there again.",4,ew Sep 2015

My brother lives in Bombay and we have many friends there too but this was a birthday celebration and we decided to posh it up a bit. At the outset, let me just say that the staff was excellent, very courteous and helpful. Once they knew this was a birthday, they upgraded us to a higher room class. Our room too was perfect, with a panoramic view of the Arabian sea. The room was luxurious too. However, I could not but help notice how a lot of the fittings, electronics (like the phone) and furniture was very clearly old and worn out.

I appreciated the personal touches in the room and general etiquette of the staff but thought maybe it was a little much to complete your check in in your room with you.  Hotel was of an excellent standard generally, rooms we'll equipped and decent in size. Food was good and there was generally a diverse selection. Some of the facilities seemed a little dated and will need improvement in the future but I guess we're in keeping with the traditional style of the hotel.  Bar service was incredibly slow which was a shame.  I'd definitely stay here again if I found myself in Mumbai again. ",4,Sep 2015

The Toto value addition to the toilets is a great icing on the cake and well worth staying in these rooms just for that privilege.

The food was nice and specially the Thai green curry.. Loved the spread at the mini bar but I wish they had put more chocolates as I'm a big big chocolate lover.. The laundry service was good... I loved the bathroom though it was almost reminding me of a palace... Thanks for helping me in for a late check out around 4pm... In short u guys are really the best in hospitality... Wah Taj.. The wi fi was smooth n fast and the drop to the airport was smooth n fast.…,5,w Aug 2015

Reception through to the pool area is faultless in its cleanliness and service.  The Vista restaurant staff, especially Deepesh, Ganesh and Vaibhau(?) took excellent care of us for the whole 2 weeks.  The restaurant manager and the beautiful young lady who escort you to your table (sorry I don't have her name) were so welcoming you couldn't fail to start the day in a happy mood.

Not that I would want to watch TV in the bath, but having it, and seeing it installed the wrong way around says something. The service wasn't as good as previous visits (I have stayed here a lot). The Taj Club rooms not coming with a one way airport transfer is disappointing. This is fairly recent (ie. in the past 12 months this has changed). It is becoming more expensive to stay when you consider all things.",4,w Aug 2015

In the room,which had a great view and was very comfortable,the welcome platter consisted of one small sweet which was quite clearly a mistake and either because it was put together in a hurry or a left over from the previous occupants.

It was very luxurious and the view of the Arabian Sea was spectacular. Since we were newly weds, they left us a chocolate cake, a bouquet and a personal note. That was so thoughtful! The food is a bit pricey but totally worth it. We had a butler service which was amazing. All in all, this hotel is my no.1 choice in Mumbai.

So, dont expect a night club or a love band playing in one of the restaurants. Since it is pricey, even the tourists coming here are more sophisticated (and advanced in age!!).  However, where the hotel excels is its service consistency. I travel to Mumbai often for business and I hate surprises.  So the hotel does a good job of eliminating surprises of any kind.

We saw that the food had been laid out ... Not for eating only to see from a distance .It was one in afternoon so we had no option but try another restaurant in the hotel ; rather than go elsewhere  We opted for the Maritime Italian Restaurant in the hotel . Great ambience , very fancy and helpful hotel staff , Outrageously priced but more outrageous was the food . Except the starter Foccacia the others fell short of expectation.

This was our home for 17 days in dec. -jan; 2014-2015. We had a good time at this hotel. The children enjoyed the poolarea and green areas. That was nice. This hotel is busy and that makes it very interesting.  We had a big fuss at the start re. our rooms eventhough we reserved in advance, six months before. We had no rooms when we arrived. They put us in temporary rooms. We got a sketchy explanation from the club receptionist and not until I said that I wanted to talk to the GM they gave us a proper room, that was 36 hours after arriving.

The hotel has a beautiful lobby, the food choice is great and the rooms are very spacious. I usually judge a hotel room by the bathroom, and these rooms are large with everything you need. The pool area is relaxing and well looked after. My only grievances would be the area around the hotel (but you have to remember, you are in India and in the capital) by taxis are cheap to wherever you need to go. The lifts are slow at busy periods and the bar is too open space for my liking.",4,w Jul 2015

Its washrooms built in old fashion luxurious way is also simply awesome.  Its coffee shop and chinese restaurant has great food which you would surely enjoy.  Must try is the complementary cookies served with coffee. Simply amazing!!!!,4,w Jul 2015
2945,Crusader_wiz,"Had a weekend stay at Taj Lands End with family. As usual the Taj hotels service is class apart and makes you choose Taj properties over other ones. The personal touch and care is amazing and it makes your trip memorable. This Taj property is more suited for business travelers than the Taj Palace Hotel but it still has all the requisite material for a family holiday stay. Having booked the Taj Club Room, we got a room with a view on the 21st floor. The Bandra Worli Sea Link looks grand and beautiful from the room and one should ask for the room which has this view. The access to the Club lounge is an added bonus for Taj Club rooms bookings since it provides a good, secluded, comforting place to have your breakfast, evening Hi-tea and cocktails.

When we arrived we found there are a couple of people ahead of us, waiting to be seated. While there more and more residents appeared and I thought we’d never get a table!

The few people who complain are just being too demanding and unrealistic considering the staff went way overboard to ensure even the minutest request was fulfilled almost immediately.  Also love the in room check-in feature, specially after an18 hr flight. Multiple staff members acknowledged us by our last name during the course of our 8 day stay simply because they remembered us from previous trip almost a year ago.

For a city location it doesn't get better than this, the rooms are beautifully and comfortably done and the service is beyond compare. Why I'm writing again is because the hotel's Sunday brunch is even more spectacular than ever and that is really saying something because it was already sensational. Not sure how they've done it but from the dim sum to the French styled pates, savory lamb and chicken dishes, Indian curries and a dessert spread that is mesmerizing to see and each preparation more tantalizing than the last. This is a meal you will never forget. They've also added specialty cocktails to imbibe, creative and fun. We love calling the Taj our home whenever we are in Mumbai/Bandra!",5,w Jul 2015

Another plus was complimentary cake service (it was my wife's birthday) at midnight to make my stay memorable and all smiles for my wife and also showed another TAj tradition of making the guest feel most comfortable as even upon insisting it was not charged to my room.   look forward to visit again soon.",5,w Jul 2015

They preempt your needs - be it room type; location; temperature or a firm pillow. All this so the guest can focus on the intent of his/he visit and not worry about the mundane..

Taj Land's End has been around for a while, and in a city where getting a decent skyline view is at a premium, its prominent place at the very edge of Bandra gives it that special advantage. Lobby, hallways and rooms are impeccably outfitted, equipment is top-notch, sleep quality is perfect.

Starting from  the check in experience to the food to the check out---one had no compliant's....Truly Taj hospitality at its best",5,w Jun 2015

3007,991Kaushik,"This June I had to visit Mumbai with some business requiring me to visit Chembur & Mahim,so we decided to stay inland at this beautiful property in Bandra. I amazed by this hidden gem at the water front just few blocks away from the Bandra-Worli sea link Indeed it offered a fantastic view of the modern architectural wonder & the changing skyline of the Mahim Bay with new skyscrapers being constructed  I was upgraded to club floor where I could have my morning breakfast on the 21st floor enjoying the view away from crowded  coffee shop & my breakfast client meeting was a successful  Of course I could reach my destination much quicker  from Bandra",5,Jun 2015

3010,sinanan,"Still the best hotel to stay in if you are based in the Bandra area. Excellent staff and rooms. Lovely location especially if you fancy spotting SRK's famous palace a few doors away. Rooms overlooking the iconic (for Mumbai) 'Sea Link' bridge are fab but the view at night is a bit crap as it is not well lit. Not the Taj's fault though! This is my second favourite Taj in Mumbai after, of course, the Palace in Colaba which is in a class of its own.",5,Jun 2015
3011,Nikhil,After years of visiting lands end finally for a chance to stay there for 4 days courtesy an executive education program.   Clearly the highlight of my stay was the really wonderful view of the sea link from my room. There are also rooms that look out onto the other side which has just the sea to see which were also awesome. Even the treadmills in the gym are placed in such a way that you can enjoy the sunset while you walk or run which was lovely.   Given that all our meals were banquets food was pretty good with nice variety and efficient service.   But all of this was offset by the most outdated or out of order set of lifts I have ever experienced in any hotel. Average waiting time was between 7 to 10 minutes. Once inside there was little or no AC and we were packed in Jowl to…,3,w Jun 2015

3015,bhavanajaiswal,"I must start by saying I'm a big fan of the Taj hospitality, and it's really difficult to have anything but praises for the way they host you.  Land's End is situated in Bandra Reclamation, with a gorgeous view of the Arabian sea on one side, and the Sea Link on the other. My room was on the 14th floor and gave me an amazing, uninterrupted view of the sea. I really feel there's nothing better one can wake up to than sun-kissed waves. The room, as in any other Taj, are spacious & luxurious. The bathroom is huge, esp. considering this is Mumbai we're talking about. There are separate bath & shower areas. The only weird thing I found was that the toilet had bidets, and no jets. I expect that in Europe, but definitely not in India!  The breakfast buffet was nice, but as some other…",5,Jun 2015

Above all I felt very safe to be alone in this hotel.",5,Jun 2015

The bathroom facilities are below average in particular bath tub too deep and getting in & out very difficult. There are no front mirror near bathroom sink, side mirror inconvinient to use.  Choice of food selections limited in the restaurent and very expensive. Not worth trying even. Sea facing rooms may sound very good but after subset, their is nothing to see, its all dark. Never chhose a room facing sea rather choose a room facing Mumbai city where the view is good.",3,w Jun 2015
3022,MukulJain_2014,The hotel is just too good. The service exemplary and staff takes due care to ensure all guests are comfortable. The rooms offered to us were very nice and provided all basic amenities. The swimming pool of the hotel is amazing and loved spending time at the pool. Overall an awesome experience.,5,Jun 2015
3023,MisraAbhishek,One would expect class from taj group and they deliver. Its a smart place to be at and they exploit the location so well. The  whole set up is done well and priced well.

3028,BS23,"I stayed at the Taj for two months. I'm not too keen on living in a hotel room for such a time but the friendliness of the staff helped me get through it. The hotel is comfortable and I was well looked after. I have only marked it average for location. Bandra is a pleasant enough area, but it's not as interesting as South Mumbai.",4,Jun 2015
3029,harmeetdhillon,"We were here to celebrate our fifth anniversary. From the moment we checked-in, it was an amazing experience. Since I had informed at the time of booking that it was our anniversary, the hotel staff made sure that our check-in was smooth, the executive escorted us to our room which was well decorated and they arranged for a cake as well........ The room was very spacious, amazing view of the sea and sea-link, nice bathrooms and nice cushion to sit on the bay window.... All in all it was not just worth the money that we spent, but even the time and energy in deciding and executing.. and on top of all this, the food was amazing........",5,Jun 2015

We have no words to describe the warmth and attention received from the moment of our arrival to our departure from all quarters. The room was extremely comfortable and provided with all comforts.

The food did get on to be after 2 nights of stay as  the breakfast and lunch were repeat menu's. One area to improve is to have more dedicated services for children - a play area, i did find it challenging to keep my kids entertained and busy at the same time while i was really caught up with my conference.",4,w Jun 2015
3033,Omar,If you are looking for excellent service and culinary delights- don't miss Taj Lands End Hotel in Mumbai. With well trained and very helpful staff you feel like a Maharajah with all services at beck and call. I had four days and nights of excellent service at this hotel. The breakfast spoilt me for choice and as a result I had to use the excellent gym to burn of the calories!,5,iew Jun 2015

Everything from check-in (swift, efficient and pleasant), breakfast (great spread - they have the BEST MASALA DOSA EVER!), dinner (I ate at the Italian), bar (had a few drinks there) to the room itself. Very comfortable, courteous staff and all the amenities one could need. I even got a haircut at their salon and it came out very well :-)  I cant find any flaws and hope they keep up the good work. This is going to be my destination of choice when I am in Bombay next.",5,w Jun 2015
3036,SashMumbai,Poor attention to detail. Zero anticipation of clients needs even when you are a repeat visitor. Indifferent hospitality and very indifferent food. There is an absence of leadership which is apparent . Great location and a fabulous view which somewhat mitigates some of the shortcomings A Hotel which seems to take its customers for granted,3,Jun 2015
3037,Ashwin,"Great Location, great view of Sea link and Arabian sea, Excellent property. Old hotel, good pool and average dining experience (food was not value for the money).

The property is no doubt one of the best located and tastefully maintained. Location is bandra bandstand. Near by markets -pali hill and hill road.Small Garden, swimming pool, gym, rooms all are nicely maintained. Nice quality toiletries. Awesome sea view from room.   I had many bitter experiences during my stay at hotel. I hope it shouldn't be case with others. I might be one of chances. Hope Gaurav and Himdari have already worked on the issues I reported during my stay. This time I should see the difference.

(which is what Taj is reputed for)  They weren't notified about the inclusions of their stay, even though I had specifically instructed the staff (as it was a surprise) and the staff were not as friendly and welcoming.  I would not recommend this place to anyone, unless their purpose of visit is official and Business related.",3,w May 2015

A couple of points that I think they can work on: Plug points in the room: There are no plug points at the desk which is a shame if someone wants to work with a laptop and a phone. I had to really hunt for plug points and even for one by the bedside was hard to reach and required some moving of furniture Bathroom amenities: No hair dryer, no weighing scale, no ear buds etc in the bathroom, which were there the last time I stayed here and are there at the Trident where I usually stay.

The furnishings around the hotel are opulent and the service is excellent with plenty of help at hand. Breakfast had a superb selection of fruit and good freshly cooked Indian and western food. The samba was smooth and tastily spiced unlike many. I was less impressed by the buffet where the food was fine but the main meal and salads less varied and enticing than in many other similar buffets. There were however a number of faults in my room.

Needless to say, when I returned to the Taj Lands End for a quick 2-day stay I was excited and looking forward to it. Alas, I was disappointed to find that the only thing to really look forward to here is the legendary Taj name. I had just returned from a trip to Chennai where I stayed at the Park Hyatt and boy was the difference night and day.  To ensure I'm not being completely jaded, let me begin by saying that most of the staff here was excellent. As with most Indian hotels, the staff will bend over backwards if you are a foreigner or an NRI. Also, the property is just as beautiful as I remember it.

Having a room with a view of the Sea link and the sea was extra special. the grounds are immaculate and the pool was a welcome relief after a day of touring. the breakfast buffet / lunch and dinner buffets all had excellent choices of Indian food and international cuisine so everyones tastes were satisfied.

Plus its so much more relaxing and quiet than the hush hush of the airport hotels.  Taj group knows how to pamper their guests. We had opted for a butler service and it was certainly above expectation. The hotel served us one of their special freshly made cakes as it was our anniversary. The cake wasn't requested or ordered.

I stayed in a sea view room which provided me with the most beautiful views of the sunset each night, the room was emmaculate, the beds comfortable and the room and bathroom spacious, modern and impeccably clean.

When we reached hotel, there was a long queue for check-in and no one really bothered to help you check-in faster and give you that special Taj experience(welcome drink etc.). I then caught hold of one of the staff member after waiting for about 10 mins, and expressed my dissatisfaction, quickly my check-in was done, let alone other guests. I was given a room on the lower floor (as I was redeeming my points on my Taj inner circle gold card, which was OK). I requested whether I can get upper floor room, the attendant said he will get back to me in few minutes so we didn't open our bags for few minutes waiting for him to get back, but he never got back.

Excellent quality of toiletries but no toothbrush, paste, shaking kit n loofah. The in room dining menu has an elaborate list of Indian, Chinese, Italian and continental.

The Taj Club experience is definitely worth the extra here. The club breakfast is perhaps a little limited in choice, however you can ask for anything, and one of the butlers will oblige. The gym has a very good weights area with free weights and machines, along with treadmills. As with any hotel, the treadmills tend to fill up at morning peak - around 7am - 8am. The location is very convenient if you have meetings in the northern areas of the city. The Worli sealink also makes it easy these days to get into downtown. Staff are extremely good, and the food is good. I will always stay here when visiting Mumbai.",5,w May 2015

Service levels are good with staff being very helpful.  Would use this hotel again.,4,w May 2015

And of course the Club Rooms come with Butler Service and Club Lounge Access. The room itself is nice and spacious. The service is very prompt, only I felt it lacked the traditional warmth of the Taj Group. Maybe because the hotel was busy at the time.   The food option is great although we stuck to the Pizza at the Vista. Love the Pizza here. Breakfast spread was good.",4,May 2015

The rooms are dated and a lot of technical problems such as switches not working thus causing other inconveniences. Because my bathroom lights couldn't shut, the bathroom heater would run all night and end up drying the room up. On top of that, the light would be on all night which was pretty annoying. If you do stay at the hotel, I would recommend to stay in the newer rooms.  In terms of security, i felt safe though. Every ride into the hotel involved a security check which made me feel safe.",4,May 2015

They say it is free and there is a premium paid service. The WiFi quality is very poor. The speeds are very low and unreliable. This is true even in their club rooms. Inspite of repeated feedbacks this is not resolved.  Most websites are not accessible under the complimentary program.

Aside from the fact we were paying for it we have a young baby so yes hot water is required. At breakfast we had often had to ask twice for coffee, call twice to find out where room service was etc. Some aspects were still amazing-we were left things for the baby, restaurant staff were accommodating of our pushchair etc. We were apologised to profusely for the inconveniences etc etc but at 5 star prices I would expect a service to match.

The inclusive buffet breakfast was a great selection of Western and Indian cuisine. The South Indian selection was really good and worth trying. There are loads of good restaurants in the Bandra area and its a relatively safe and quieter part of Mumbai when compared to the Colaba area. I recommend taking a rickshaw/Tuktuk to Linking Road or Hill Road as there are some good restaurants and shopping in the area. The hotel staff arduously very helpful and the female manager (European) goes out of her way to assist. Highly Recommended!!!",5,Feb 2015
3270,RajGohil,"Stayed here for a few nights as came to Mumbai for a conference.  Great hotel, nice food, good gym.  Banda is area full of bollywood stars and sports stars and you do bump into them regularly. azz ar ( former indian test captain) was there everyday ( apparently lives next door) and deepika ( don't know surname!!) was there for lunch...a list bollywood star!  Only tiny downside was wifi being slow but rang and advised and guy did come to sort out or move the router in room!",5,Feb 2015
3271,mukas,"In the big Lobby on ground floor where Hotel guests or visitors may take rest, work on their laptops, make phone calls from their smartphone, there is not a single power socket in-built on the floor. I had to charge my Laptop, then my Smartphone and had to go Business Center for the same. What a pity!",2,Feb 2015
3272,Tom,This hotel was quite a pleasant revelation. It is on a commanding point overlooking the water and the beautiful Crosslink bridge. The surrounding neighborhood is a mix of lively beach goers and old colonial homes. The hotel is a perfectly run luxurious property. The grounds are green and cool with an offshore breeze and beautiful landscaping.  I had a Taj Club room on the 22nd floor with a perfect view of the water. The room was large and well appointed . My favorite touch was the French press coffee pot with fresh coffee and real milk in the minibar. Sure beats Nescafe and powdered creamer. The bathroom had a full marble shower as well as a tub and a heated toilet seat. Very cool. The staff were beyond attentive and not a single detail was overlooked during my three day stay. …,5,w Feb 2015
3273,LadyBKent_UK,"We have stayed here a few times now and it is always very good. The staff are always very courteous, polite and friendly. Breakfast buffet is excellent and provides a better choice than the club lounge. Service was slower this year, though. Some of the rooms are somewhat old fashioned, and need renovating , presume they are gradually doing this . Club rooms are better. Spa and gym excellent. Pool lovely. Pay for extra strength wi fi .",5,Feb 2015
3274,sheekha_k,We have stayed at the Lands end on many occasions. It's always been great. The club class rooms are better than the regular rooms - which are not sound proof. Always insist on rooms 22nd floor and above - these are the renovated club class rooms and are very comfortable. The restaurants have great food though the service has gone down in the past couple of years.,4,Feb 2015
3275,Bombayduck1,"I enjoyed my short stay (3 nights) at this hotel, the room was very comfortable and quiet, with a splendid view of the Arabian Sea. The service was very friendly and efficient, with utmost attention to details. It was a treat to stay in a major 5 star hotel in Mumbai which was not like a railway station. Breakfast was excellent and the food in the Masala Bay restaurant was superb.The Hotel is very well located about 25 min by car from the International airport. It is also very close to the Sea-Link bridge and the ultra modern Bandra-Kurla Complex, where many banks and businesses have now relocated. I visited the Mount Mary's Church about 5 mins. from the hotel.",5,Feb 2015
3276,Natarajan,"The total stay experience at Taj Land's End  was memorable for me.   Most of the features that a frequent Business Traveller would expect were available perfectly!   Superb location,l very fine ambience, comfortable and well-maintained rooms, very responsive and caring service, and what not!  But  a few details of catering to specifc requests of customers, such as a special item of food, or a particular newspaper, etc, could be better handled! also, the instructions reg: billing should be handled  more carefully and error-free to avoid delay and annoyance to the guest at the time of check-out!",4,w Feb 2015
3277,sunnyahuja4586,Very good hotel have stayed here a couple of times. Has a very nice banquet also the Chinese restaurant on the 1st floor is great. Surroundings are good too located in bandstand bandra. Definitely reco. a stay here.,5,Feb 2015
3278,Alexuty,"The foyer/entrance hall is massive with a bar reasonably priced for a 5-star hotel. Rooms come with all amenities and high-standard services. Compared to the Taj Mahal Palace at the gate of India, this one will feel less cramped. It's close to Carter road and to roam around in Bandra. Even to go to the southern part the Bandra-Worli sealink (for a 55RS single journey fee) provides a fast transfer. Will stay here again.",5,Jan 2015
3279,Harshdeep87,"Had been there last month for business meeting and stayed two nights. The view of the sea, swiming pool and the bandra sealink was quite attracting. It was my first stay at a Taj property  The staff is courteous. The rooms were elegantly furnished. Most night spots in Bandra are easily accessible. I will definitely return once again for a relaxing holiday.",4,Jan 2015
3280,thesagittarian,"Had been there last week for a conference and stayed a night - Its a gorgeous property - the view of the sea and the bandra sealink from Taj are stunning - was my first stay at a Taj property after a very long period and I loved it every bit. The staff were very friendly and courteous - Food is excellent - I would definitely recommend their Chinese restaurant - try to get a room on one of the higher floors with a view of the sea. The rooms were well furnished, spic, span and elegantly done - Most night spots in Bandra are easily accessible... best of all the German delegation that I was with totally enjoyed the experience and we had an excellent experience with the venue for the conference. Highly recommended - will definitely return",4,Jan 2015

3282,prnrp,"Its just superb. The ambience, though very simple, is extremely attractive. Very courteous staff and excellent service. The location is sea facing and accessible both from Airport as well as from the southern business district. This makes Taj Land's End my favourite destination.",5,Jan 2015
3283,ChiragVaishnav,"Stayed here for night and everything was perfect. Right from checkin to checkout this hotel and it's staff exceeded our expectations. The checkin was smooth and the staff who checked us in was well mannered. We were taken to the 22nd floor and on entering the room, the staff informed us that we had been upgraded to a suite! The suite had a sitting area with comfortable sofa and desk and a huge TV. The bedroom had similar TV and of course a very comfortable and inviting bed. The bathroom was perfect. The pantry was well stocked with soft and hard drinks. And lastly the view is to die for.   To sum it up, I would say that this hotel lives up to it's brand name and I would love to come back again.",5,Jan 2015

3285,eros2agape,We spent our first 2 nights as a couple at the Taj Lands End Bandra! The club rooms were spacious and regal with a wonderful view of the iconic Bandra Worli Sea Link. The service impeccable as expected with the Taj. The club rooms also come with access to a sprawling breakfast complimentary with the room and also high tea and cocktails in the evening :-)  Thank you - our first steps in married life were with you and that will always be special for us Cheers,5,Jan 2015
3286,RocketCaptain,While I've stayed here before this time was my best experience. Very friendly and casual check in. Large room on 22 floor overlooking the Arabian Sea. Luxurious bathroom with TV. Impeccable butler service. Room make up and turndown excellent. Reasonably good breakfast buffet. Free wi-fi (which should be standard everywhere). Didn't have time to eat in any of the fine restaurants as we were busy savouring the flavours in the Bandra eateries.  No complaints except the in room safe numbers are difficult to read. ,5,Jan 2015
3287,Pratima,This was my first visit to India and am so glad that I started it by staying at Taj Lands End.  The reception we got from the time our taxi pulled in at the main entrance was the ultimate in  Indian hospitality.  We were greeted by Nikita Jani and she made sure that we were comfortable and looked after our needs right away.  All the staff starting from Bell Boys to Reception to Restaurant staff and Housekeeping staff always greeted us with a smile and Namaste and made us feel so welcomed.  The rooms were very comfortable with newspapers delivered every morning.  The restaurant had excellent breakfast and dinners.,5,w Jan 2015
3288,Jaideep1,"Having a very old rectangular boxy television set in a five star deluxe room is indeed quite funny in an era of flat screen/plasma/LCD/LED/3D/Smart TV :) But that's what is there at Taj Lands end, still in 2015 !  Very spacious room & multi-compartment bathroom, nice views of the Arabian Sea. Great restaurants. Check in was smooth, friendly and always eager-to-please staff.  Just that needs to be upgraded.",4,Jan 2015
3289,Christine,"Hi, I stayed at this resort for 2 nites, and it was an amazing experience. The views were fantastic that over looked the Sea Link. I particularly wanted to thank Samantha Francis and Blair Quinny for their courteous and helpful service. I would definitely recommend this hotel.",5,w Jan 2015
3290,Jet1999,"This is one of my favourite hotels in Mumbai.  First, some practicalities.  Mumbai is a huge city and travel times can be long.  If you're looking for a luxury hotel close to, but away from ,the airport ambience, with impressive sea views and allowing nearly always within about 40 minutes from the airport, I highly recommend you stay here.  The rooms are large and very comfortably equipped. Great bathrooms with all the accessories provided.  You can work South Mumbai from here with some planning and I've done that a few times. Please do note that this is a busy and generally business oriented hotel so, if you're looking for somewhere really quiet/romantic (other than in the rooms), you might need to look elsewhere.  I think the pricing for the service is fair too.",4,Jan 2015
3291,AlexandraH1960,"I was just here for a business visit, and was more than a little disappointed. It was lovely to be upgraded to a club floor room, which was splendid. The location of the hotel was pleasant. Breakfast and the lunch buffet were of a very good standard. My room was well maintained. But, sadly, the level of service was really off key, throughout the hotel and throughout my stayl - consistently offhand, slightly slapdash, with a general feel that was unprofessional and disorganised. My last Taj experience at the start of my current work trip was at the Taj Coromandel, Chennai. The Taj Lands End would do well to learn from the customer service experience offered by that hotel, which was first rate.",3,Jan 2015
3292,Sujay,"Nice hotel, good rooms, pool and garden. Excellent check-in check-out process. Food is sometimes disappointing and generally good. Quality of Indian tea needs improvement. The service during breakfast could be fine tuned further. Sometimes the staff (waiters) appear rude.  In general, will visit again.",4,w Jan 2015
3293,Frannk982,If you have a sea view room this is a great experience. The hotel oozes quality and the sea view is breathtaking. The buffet breakfast is excellent. Other meals are not so great and are expensive. Unfortunately there is nowhere else nearby except for street food on the water front (cheese sandwiches). The airport is a good 30 minute drive away. The hotel taxi is eye-wateringly expensive. I went outside the hotel gate and haggled a (non-aircon) taxi down to 450 rupees but he would not use the meter. The hotel offered a sea view room on floor 15 for 10000 rupees inc breakfast and tax (through booking.com).,4,Jan 2015
3294,Resha_K,"Taj hospitality and Service are always talked about and this place does complete justice to the same. Even before we were out of our cab, the hotel staff was ready to welcome us. The security process is also carried out very warmly without giving any feel of inconvenience.  We just stayed for one day at this place and would definitely be our choice of stay whenever we visit Mumbai. Location is another plus point  with bandstand and bandra fort being at walking distance- making it perfect for an evening stroll. Also if you are an SRK fan, Mannat- SRKs abode is right there. :)  We had opted for a Sea link view room. The view from our room was perfect and we just couldn't stop taking pictures.

Lovely views of the sea and the Bandra - Worli sealink, especially at dawn and dusk were the highlight of my stay here and will make me go back!   The lobby is large and plush without being grand. The rooms are spacious and pleasant although the fittings and finish show the age of the building. The paintings displayed in my room were quite ordinary, but there is interesting artwork in the public areas which gives it the feel of a classic old hotel ! The staff was courteous, helpful and sincere, and overall service excellent, as one expects from a Taj hotel.  There is a choice of restaurants with interesting food options.  This hotel is an excellent choice if you plan to stay…",4,Jan 2015

The staff here are the best!I have not yet come across staff that are the polite consistently.  We had 2 rooms close to each other.Very comfortable although the hotel does need a major refurbishing. Having said this what the rooms lack in modernity is made up for by the kindness of their staff..  We enjoyed several spa appointments and absolutely loved each one.  We were however very disappointed with the behaviour of their hair salon manager Aaliyah.Her manner to her staff was disgusting.She spoke to them in such a derogatory tone. After our visit I did write a personal letter to the manager regarding this however I never received a response.  Having said this everything…,5,w Jan 2015
3297,Sushmash,I spent two days in their board room and had sampled their different restaurants .  Ideal for few people overlooking the sea which added freshness to our discussion . Their Chinese restaurant was very good . Staff was caring and sensitive . Tried to help us . They also sent flowers and and cake as that was my friends birthday who was staying in the hotel . The food was excellent . A classy hotel with Taj touch .,4,Jan 2015
3298,Paula,"There is only one reason why there are a huge number of positive reviews for this Taj hotel located in Bandra (Mumbai's Bollywood center) and that's because it is a class act from every angle. Beautiful rooms, attentive sincere amazing staff, quality restaurants, and a lovely spa add up to a city oasis of refinement and renewal. I spend a great deal of time here as my boyfriend's family is from Bandra so this Taj has become our second home. What I wouldn't give to have it be our first home! One more point, as some have noted in their reviews, they are right the Chinese and Italian restaurants here are not reminiscent of China or Italy, but this is India, you should be eating Indian, and for that this Taj is without comparison. Their Sunday buffet will rock your world.",5,w Jan 2015

3300,livelifetravelling,"Just another visit to Mumbai and as usual in spite of being warned and disgusted by friends for staying in expensive but old and withered property I still chose to stay at Taj Lands end.   REASON - I feel some connection to this building (Yes it’s just the building which brings me back)  with such a beautiful view which is difficult (not impossible) to avoid and stay at other better quality  hotels in the vicinity.   Like I mentioned in my previous review, having a good location and great Taj brand with attractive Loyalty membership will not keep customers happy.

Overall, Taj lands end is a fantastic hotel, from service to food to rooms - everything was top notch.  Location- beautifully located by the sea overlooking the sea-link. It took us around 30 minutes from the international airport to get to the hotel. Room: luxurious room, comfortable bed, fantastic bathroom with good fittings.  Service and breakfast: staff were very helpful and courteous, breakfast spread is superb as well. Others: there's a pool and garden within the hotel premises as well which was really nice.  We had a really comfortable and enjoyable stay at the hotel, would definitely recommend it to those looking to stay there.",5,Jan 2015

The booking and reception was smooth and after a slight followup, we were impressed with the baby cot and other amenities in the hotel. The room had an amazing sea view - and we spent majority of the day near the pool and in the spa. The pool is comfy and warm with impeccable service by the attendants. Jiva Spa also lived up to its reputation. We enjoyed the cuisines both in-room and at Ming Yang and were never disappointed. The service in in-room dining especially came as a surprise when the attendant walked in with a small dining table for us!  Finally, the breakfast spread next morning was sumptuous - something to look forward to! Definitely - highly recommended…",5,Jan 2015

I really appreciate their attention to detail and an entirely different level of service delivery compared to 5-star hotels in London, Thailand or Bali. Your request was customization was Listened to and delivered appropriately. Staff were polite and tried to accommodate certain requests. The intensity of the security check could be lowered a bit! Also, the concierge could have by offering complimentary drop-offs to nearby offices! Would recommend taking a walk from nearby bandstand to carter on weekend and grab a bite or two along the way!",4,Jan 2015
3308,Diti,"My sister and I stayed at Lands End last week, and our room was upgraded free of cost (that's classic Taj hospitality). Being the cleanliness freak that I am, the first parameter for me to judge a hotel is its hygiene. My room was spotless and clean, smelling like fresh jasmine flowers, and absolutely well-maintained. I'd like to point out that some of the other 5-star properties in Mumbai that charge about the same as Taj, have not maintained their hygiene standards. If you're looking for a top-end stay, opt for a Taj property by all means. Secondly, the view..stunning! My room on the 20th floor overlooked the Mumbai sea-link and the pristine blue sea.

On my complaint, was asked if air freshner would help. Got transferred to another room. It looked like too m had not been used for months. TV - from 1980's. This would classify as a standard room in  3 star hotel. I don't know how Taj can justify charging so much for these type of rooms. Finally got transferred to a more acceptable room. Unfortunately all this happened in late evening - when no senior managers are on hand to take a decision. So check which rooms you are being given - avoid 11th & 12th Floor.",3,Jan 2015

Met at the airport with a fleet of vehicles to accommodate my party of 9 and all our luggage.  Greeted on the steps of the hotel with garlands and taken to our suite for check in.  Welcome by our butler with delicious cold drinks.  All this is a style that only Taj manage. Service throughout was perfection.  The minibus I asked for to take us shopping down town broke down but the found a 48 seater (for 9 of us!) at no extra charge.  The food in both the Chinese and Italian restaurants was excellent.,5,Jan 2015

The reservation (for five nights) was not very smooth as we had to check with the hotel multiple times to get confirmation in writing. The location of the property is excellent and our room at 18th floor provided was overlooking the swimming pool and lawns. From the corridor window we also enjoyed the view of Sea Link. The room size was okay however the noises in the corridor were disturbing during the night. The BF spread was kind of repetitive and limited. The property has a good swimming pool with Jacuzzi that my kids enjoyed.",3,review Jan 2015

First and foremost I have to comment on the location, absolutely lovely. On the sea front, 'Bandra Side', as most of my Mumbai friends would describe it, and yet close enough to the sealink for easy access into town. Check in was smooth, the lobby had a wonderful hustle bustle reflecting the high energy and vibrancy of the city.

Overall a pleasant stay. The only drawback is the internet is expensive.   ,4,Dec 2014

Our room was perfect as it can get, we requested for a soft bed the staff ensured that we get one to our satisfaction. Our room offered the city, sea and pool view … the big French window and the sitting space around that has a charm of its own.

However I do carry a sneaking feeling that ehen they have too many guests at breakfast they get a little overwhelmed. Topping up the buffet takes time and food quality falls. At least this happened to us. I am sure however that this being the Taj, such an incident was just that -a rare lapse, and will be amply attended to.",4,w Dec 2014
3345,Neeraj,Good location in Bandra facing the sea. Its best known neighbour is Bollywood star Shah Rukh Khan whose house is almost next door. It has a nice neighbourhood feel due to being the residential part of South Mumbai. The hotel lobby is a bit drab though quite large with the potential of looking much nicer. It did not look like the most posh hotel's lobby which we expected from a prime Taj property. The staff was very courteous though and made up for the lack of 5 star deluxe feel in the hotel.   The Club floor rooms were very old style and we were quite disappointed and asked for a room change from the club floor rooms to a regular floor with renovated rooms. The club floor is value only if you can use the club lounge extensively. The removated rooms however were quite nice and…,3,w Dec 2014

He said, for the same price, he was upgrading our room from deluxe to superior.  This seemed like a good thing.  I was surprised then, when we got off the elevator to note a musty smell accented with floral plug-ins.  The room smelled musty too.  New to coastal Asia, I thought it perhaps had something to do with the sea location.  We cranked up the A.C. and opened the automatic curtain to admire the incredible view of the Arabian Sea and the Worli Sea-Link Bridge.  The room was huge and the bathroom, too.

Luckily each time we opted for three different views, but our favourite was bandstand and poolside view, the mid sea view is refreshing but very quite...

The service has gone down hill, there was a new Senior Management change recently, and I suspect that the new Management vision of being penny pinching, rude, and impersonal have trickled down from there.They simply have managed to loose their Class, which is terrible for a brand with such a long standing and distinguished history in India.  The rooms at Taj Lands End, are dirty, there is a lack of general attention paid to cleaning. Termite dust, dead insects, dust on headboards, bathroom tissue not re stocked, Mold on ceilings, (attributed to the corner cutting of not air conditioning hallways but doing so in rooms). …",2,w Nov 2014

The lobby is nice and shiny though the rooms do look like they are a few years old.  But all this takes a back seat compared to the excellent service. Across the board the staff was attentive, willing and helpful.

We were pleasantly surprised when we were upgraded from the Deluxe Room to the Luxury Room on the 17th floor. The view is lovely, the rooms spacious, well appointed & comfortable, yet have a comfortable worn out look. The bathrooms are spacious & even have a bathtub.   We have usually stayed on the Club floors of this hotel, which are fantastic. We found the rooms on the 17th floor to be very noisy. One can hear the adjoining room doors open / shut, the housekeeping activities & vacuuming, the chattering of the hotel guests in the hallway. We…",4,Oct 2014
3385,SVMet,A bit late in writing the review. Spent 3 nights at the Taj Lands End when I travelled to Mumbai on business. Great service as with most Taj hotels. The breakfast was really good.

I have travelled to many countries and hence writing this.  Wonder why the service was bad ? Any guesses ? Well they dont levy any service charge on the bill. But it doesnt deserve to be a TAJ property.  No doubt the location is excellent. best view, quiet at the end of the world as the name says - Lands End. But the service at Taj President at cuffe parade coffee shop even at 2 AM in the morning is excellent.  But the spread of the food was ok - nothing great. They were so smart to keep the deserts in the passage which looked like you have to go to another room to get the desserts. No one - none of the staff or the…",1,Oct 2014

The poolside staff, room service, gym staff and restaurant staff were all very friendly and accommodating with our requests. At the pool you are welcomed with a cool towel, bottle of water and at 12:00pm and 5:00pm fresh fruit kebabs were handed around to guests by the pool.

The service is tip-top, in fact we heard several times that 'the guest is god' and that is exactly how the staff act. Club level rooms are the way to go. Lovely relaxing lounge.  Nothing is too much trouble. The icing on the cake was being taken to the airport in the hotel Jaguar. How nice is that??

Maybe after a few days.  I hear it's very good.  The buffet breakfast is excellent! People seem to miss the crispy crepe-like Indian dish which comes stuffed with potatoes.  Just ask for it and they will bring it to you.  It's good with cilantro-mint chutney or coconut.  You. An also request for espresso and cappuccino - for no additional cost.

I would certainly stay again if it was not for the isolated location, which I did obviously know when booking.

If you see my other blogs/reviews on tripadvisor, you would see how impressed I am with their services.   So I check in and am escorted to the room but still the first thought that hit me was despite me telling the checking in staff that this is my first time at this property, I was not given any information about the property / / property tour / where will the breakfast be served etc..

Also the hotel room needs to be upgraded as the TV in my room was a 25 inch CRT and also some of the daily needs were not readily available... you had to ask for them.

This is a 5* hotel but as many reviewers have said before, it is the level of service that marks it out as one of the best. We ate in all of the restaurants and were bowled over by the standard of food and service. Ming Yang is a really top class Chinese restaurant, Maritime is an Italian restaurant (an offshoot of San Lorenzo in London) where we ate twice a week apart - the waiter remembered which wine I had chosen the week before and asked me whether I wanted the same.

To Vista restaurant's magnificent buffets. After a few days the staff will know what you like. If I chose a curry for dinner. The garlic naan would just arrive.

Staying in a city, so famous and so busy that never sleeps, I was anxious not to miss the opportunity to enjoy the magnificent view of the sea, glowing in the sun, perturbed by the stormy winds, shivering in the rain or shuddering in the dark. I used to draw the curtains in the morning and also in the evening, whenever I got a chance to return early from my workplace. The rooms were “well appointed” as they say for the comfort of the occupant. The cheerful staffs of all level were ready to help, their behavior was very cordial.

In recent years since the Mumbai attacks on the Taj, I have been staying at the Taj Lands end in Bandra Bandstand. It's time I wrote about my various experiences here.  The location of the hotel is excellent, being next to the Sea Link bridge. Surrounded by houses belonging to various Bollywood celebrities,( SRK's house being just a few buildings away and Salman's a stones throw) and the sea, this is a good place to relax.

I checked in at 7am and I wanted to rest after a whole night travel but no blackout curtain was available . The TV set dates decades before since they are still using the 29ins box tv. When I called reception to change room since I had already settled answer was no room available on same floor will have to wait. Room change was entertained round 11 when a duty manager called in person to inform me about new room. I had to manage my shifting alone with the amazed look of the manager.

Definitely take cabs while here.  The hired car at the hotel can cost about $50, but it is worth it if you are new to Mumbai.  Mumbai is a very busy congested place.  I would recommend the hired car on your first venture out of the hotel.  After that, there are cold cabs (air conditioned), just below the hotel that the bell hop will flag for you.  My trip from Land's End to the Airport was only 500 Indian in the cold cab.  This is also a nice place if you want to be a little out of the way in Mumbai.

This is the first time this has happened to me at any hotel and speaks volumes for the attentive and professional way that the Taj's staff interact with customers ,5,w Aug 2014

They have a Sony Home Theater system in the rooms on which you can enjoy FM radio or even play your own songs. The breakfast menu is amazing. The life guard/instructor at the swimming pool was quite helpful and gave me a few tips on my breaststroke, which proved useful. Last few times stayed at Renaissance and missed the Taj.",5,eview Aug 2014

I had a full sea facing room(overlooking bandstand), and oh my, the views in the morning after waking up were just astounding. Hotel facilities are so-so, nothjbg you wouldnt find at a standard 3-star hotel anywhere in the world. The location of the hotel is quite nice, close enough to Bandra restaurants and pubs but just far enough to make it sort of an escape from all the noise.  The breakfast buffet was average, ive had better at other hotels. I will remember this buffet though, for the most rubbery bacon i have ever had. Overall, i think the next time i would rather stay at the taj palace in colaba (i prefer colaba over bandra anyway).",4,Aug 2014

The hotel is located in the posh area of Bandra where most of the film celebrities live nearby.You can have a nice morning walk along the beach just in front of the hotel. I asked for a room with a nice sea view and the staff was kind enough to give me a room with the best view of the sea. Don't get surprised if you see film stars in the hotel.

First, I was taken to a smoking room. I didn't request a smoking room and didn't want to stay in one. The bellman called down to the desk and went to retrieve the new key. I arrived at my new non smoking room. This is NOT the taj lands end I remembered from 1 year ago. I was immediately faced with the musty, damp odor. The carpet is dirty. There appears to be blood on the throw across the bottom of the bed. The only plugs, except one, are at floor level and behind furniture. And all are Indian.

The location is excellent and the room view I got was great overlooking the Mumbai sea link and the swimming pool. Rain clouds added to the picture postcard effect from the window. The check in was very professional and smooth. The in-room dining was swift and food quality was excellent. I loved the bathroom...very unlikely to get such huge sized bathrooms in today's crammed world. Connectivity to rest of city is very good too.

The service at breakfast was not very good - we always had to ask for tea or coffee and it was always late in arriving and we never got offered a refill.

They were given a grand welcome with garlands. My daughter was delighted. We were given the room no. 1729. This was the sea facing room. In fact our room was upgraded. My daughter was extremely happy to see the décor of the room. After a little rest, she went to the pool and she and my better half thoroughly enjoyed.

Where else can you get the best pizza in town or garlic naan and butter chicken at 4am. They have the best 24 hour restaurant in town. maybe even In Asia.

I think though that those who stay for less than 7 days probably won't notice the inconsistencies that  I talk about below which become apparent after you have been here for longer than a fortnight. As others have said the location of this hotel is excellent, right on the Arabian Sea in a quiet area and it is always good to get the sea breezes.  Rooms are well appointed but some are in need of upgrading, particularly on floors 11-14 where they have 1980's box type TV's.

Lovely Hotel to stay in the breakfast was lovely and a good selection of items and they were ready and willing to make you anything you wanted to eat, we were even upgraded  The rooms were nice size and clean, only downside of the room we stayed in was you could hear next door having a shower so was disconcerting  The hotel is located next to the sea, but if you are after large shopping malls and nice shops to go to and restaurants this hotel is not ideally placed.

3569,chunilal3,Exquisitely proliferated entrance sets the mood for out of the ordinary experience of the interior. Gracious welcome to immaculately set-up of the suite made the stay unrivalled with anything one could experience in a similar hotel elsewhere. The view of blue Arabian sea was a perfect ambience of outdoor lounge.,4,Mar 2014
3570,SoniaSingh,I stayed at Taj Lands End for a weekend. The hotel has almost all rooms with sea view. Feels amazing and quite relaxing. The only thing which was a bit disappointing was an old box style Television in the base category room. All other rooms have a flat screen TV. Staff is very friendly and efficient. Breakfast was good. The staff in the coffee shop were proactive and took very good care of our requirements. Overall...good experience. Strongly recommend this hotel for Couples/Families. Might not be a good choice for business travellers.,4,Mar 2014
3571,gtisi68,"I stayed here for two nights on business. A very comfortable hotel where they happily gave me a room to gain the best view of the sunset which was just about to happen on my arrival. Room very well appointed and once you got over the disconcerting automatic opening of the curtains when you put your card in the slot upon entering your room, overall a very pleasant experience. Plenty of choice at breakfast, although the bacon was a little leathery the Indian options were very tasty. I did try the Masala Bay, which was so good that I went back the second night too even though it was a little on the expensive side.",4,Mar 2014
3572,zaubererpferd,Whoever rated this hotel as contemporary 5 star venue has either little benchmark to measure With or never stayed in a 5 star hotel of the highest category. I admit I didn't belong to the visitors who spent the night in the business floors. I belonged to the smelly socks brigade who was booked in an ordinary room. Nevertheless a TV set dated back some 20 years ago and so did the whole furniture   Breakfast was by European standard limited in choice but of good quality  A plus is the setting. In a place like Mumbai a cul de sac location is a benefit. Also the staff is well trained Would try another one next time ,3,Mar 2014
3573,Apurva,"I stayed at the Lands End as a member of the Taj card program that entitles you to stay for 2 days, one night if you have accumulated sufficient points. I stayed at this at-the-tip property along with my mother and the staff was quite forthcoming and warm.  We had our meals delivered straight into our rooms and even though we wanted to dine at their restaurant, i was not feeling too well on that given day so they dispatched my evening meal into our room.  The next day one incident was that we ordered a veg. club sandwich but by mistake they sent a non-veg sandwich. When we raised the matter to room service, what they did was resend the correct sandwich to us and waived the amount from our bill.  Overall, it was a pleasant stay and anyone wanting to go to Mumbai should definitely…",4,w Mar 2014

The property is in an exceptional location with beautiful views of the Arabian Sea in the Bandra section of Mumbai away from the traffic, noise and pollution of the city.  The service from the moment your car arrives is outstanding.  The rooms are large and beautifully appointed and there is nothinig to want for.  There are sea breezes to cool you while you sit it the beautiful pool and the spa and salon are a pleasure.  Of course, the food follows right along with the Taj name and presiege,  This is a hotel I will always stay at in Mumbai.",5,Mar 2014

Punit the front desk manager was so helpful and we cannot thank him enough for all his help.  The housekeeping staff was exceptional as well.  The carpets, furniture and general decor in the rooms, lobbies and hallways need to be changed (updated).  If you need extra bottled water just speak with your room attendant.

Well, to be honest, the breakfast at Vista was really great, a real wide variety of offers for both veg and non-veg and a decent collection of cheeses on offer as well as the breads. But the rooms and toilets need to be overhauled. DId not expect chrome coatings coming off the taps nor did i expect a bad hot-cold controller for the shower and the bath. The amenities are average and not really changed or added every day. The fruit basket was there one day and then never again. There was repair work going in the room above beyond 10PM ! Yes, it stopped or rather the moise levels went down but after complaining a few times. Did not expect this , seriously.",4,w Mar 2014

Breakfast experience was good and very limited choices, IMO service was little slow. Overall it was a nice experience.",4,Feb 2014

Whats more, these 'options' are tucked away in obscure sections of the taj website and only in the fine print, you are told that these options are not available.  Other things like inadequate number of bath robes, slippers exist as well. All this can be forgiven in a cheap motel, but not in a '5 star luxury' hotel.",1,Feb 2014

With beach at a walking distance, there was the option of going but given the Mumbai beaches, preferred the view from the room which was nice. The only disappointment was the mismanagement of the breakfast, having stayed across multiple Taj properties by now, would say this is a problem across most of them. Really think they need to work upon the same... overall worth the stay.",4,eview Feb 2014

Outside the hotel, there are wild dogs on the street and the air is polluted, which is a different world from the hotel. Hotel room is spacious and quite luxurious, bed is comfortable. There is fresh flower in-room. Sea view from my room is nice. Bathroom has both bathtub and the standing one, but I would suggest that to provide a slip resistance rug because it doesn't have a handrail. There is a main control panel near the bed, it controls lighting, time, and temperature.

3591,Christopher,"From the moment I arrived at the airport until I left for my return trip the staff of this hotel were determined to fulfil my every need; even sometimes by anticipating those needs. Often the staff of a hotel are the redeeming feature but in this case the hotel itself was magnificent. Clean, well maintained and luxuriously outfitted. I could list so may features that this review would be like War and Peace but I must just rely on your imagination. For example I used the bathrobe supplied in my bedroom one day and when I put it on I literally was amazed at how soft the material was; also on this topic I would say that this is one of the few hotels where the bathrobes were generously sized enough to be comfortable.",5,w Feb 2014

Jokes apart, Land's End is brilliant in terms of the views from the rooms (esp if you get the sea-link facing rooms or the pool-facing rooms) and has one of the best breakfast spreads. My room had an old box TV which was a bit of a downer - but the electronic curtains (love it when you can open the curtains without leaving your bed), excellent bathrooms (with the duvet - rarely see that in Indian hotels) and great room-service made it a very comfortable place to stay. Do try the jacuzzi and spa services if you have time, extremely relaxing after a hard day's work. Or just hang around the lobby - you meet celebs galore at this place.",4,Feb 2014

Its one the pleasant places where the staff is ever smiling and greets you at every step, which I find very sweet. The banquet manager was cooperative enough and we had a good show!

There is no traffic in the area and you avoid a lot of traffic because of the Bandstand location. It is very scenic and near famous Bollywood homes.  The room was large with a fantastic bathroom.

3630,Alpesh-5,Stayed 6 nts over December period. Have stayed at this hotel before and was excellent. Not anymore. The hotel is now tired. There was cigarette smell in non smoking room. They have TV sets that can now qualify to be in a museum. I moved my bed in the room and found moulded crisps and old biscuit wrappers under it. When we filled up the bath and later tried to drain it the water won't drain and discovered it was blocked by bunch of hair left over a period of time blocking the drain. When the rooms on top of you flush you feel like that water is going to soon burst through your ceiling. So loud and annoying especially when it happens in middle of the night. During breakfast the queue in the main breakfast room are long and takes some time to get a table. No one told us that there…,2,Jan 2014
3631,Kathy,The Taj Lands End is a wonderful place to stay in Mumbai. The lobby area is elegant with great space for drinks and snacks. The rooms are well appointed and the service extremely attentive. I had the unfortunate experience of taking a fall while walking near Colaba Causeway and can attest to the effectiveness of the in house doctor was well as the thoughtfulness of the housekeeping staff who brought me ice packs and roses. (See attached picture of flowers. ),5,w Jan 2014
3632,skfmac,This is a really nice hotel on the Bandra side. The corniche is full with locals and very colorful. The hotel is nice....warm and friendly as soon as you get in. The lobby lounge sushi is great. I had the best foot massage ever.....by a blind therapist. I'm sorry I don't remember his name. But it was excellent. Rooms are nice and the toiletries are super nice.,5,Jan 2014
3633,SmitaRishi,"I stay at this hotel regularly on work but off late have been staying at Grand Hyatt for its convenient location. So when I checked in this evening, got a lovely letter saying welcome back! But to my amaze, the room was the worst ever...while I can't post pics of the smell, see the TV set in the room (old 21 inch Onida TV!!), crushed curtains, no toiletries in the bathroom, night service not done even when I got back at 11pm....the list is endless....Grand Hyatt, here I come!",1,Jan 2014
3634,prasan68,"I stayed a night at Land's End courtesy Standard Chartered our Hosts. Whereas location, room size etc. was fine, what shocked me was the cigarette smell in my room when I checked in. (It was a no smoking room). When I asked the lady ushering me to the room, she was apologetic and put some spray which was ineffective. i am an allergy patient and simply can't tolerate cigarette smoke, particularly indoors. There definitely seems to be  no attempt to clear the room of smoke smell for the next room occupant unless told  nor any attempt to discipline any occupant who smokes in a no smoking room and thus inconveniences the next occupant! When I asked the lady why such occupants were not fined, she shrugged and said` What can we do'.",4,Jan 2014
3635,Raghavan,We stayed at Taj Lands end from 24th Dec to 29th Dec 2013. Our room had a full sea view right infront and thats invaluable. Service at Hotel is superb. Restaurants offer good choice. Buffett breakfast every day was amazing. Christmas special decors added to the lovely lobby at ground and second floor.If you wish to tasty luxury with pleasure this is the place to be. Location is free from crowds and has a quick exit to airport and sealink.Only complaint we had was free wifi was not available in rooms which is a norm now.But cant downgrade them lower than excellent for that reason.,5,Jan 2014

Each and every detail had a professional yet warm personal touch to it. The toilets were awesome and made me feel as if I am in heaven and being treated like a Queen. The hotel staff did everything to make our stay memorable and pampered us to the core.

The staff is really one of the highlights...they are well attuned and take the time and effort to suss out the needs of guests individually, which is quite a detailed task.

Our flight arrived at 3 am so we decided to take a taxi from the airport instead of the hotel limo...not the best decision as the taxi was small and the driver took 'the long way around' getting us to the hotel. Once at the hotel, though, all negative thoughts disappeared. Check-in was smooth and the service was excellent. The garden and pool were relaxing with a spot to eat so you didn't have to move too far for a bite! Foot massages are available as you relax by the pool and are delightful. The first morning, the breakfast service was slow as we arrived at peak time. The next morning, however, we didn't even have to order as the staff remembered what we had ordered the first morning and brought it to us…",5,Jan 2014

Great service and we were upgraded to an Executive Suite as we had 2 kids in tow and they had the availability and thought we might be more comfortable.

3654,Bristolawyer,I have done a long stay (six weeks) here on business and I have just spent two weeks here with my family (wife and three children - we had two rooms) for the Xmas holiday. In my view the TLE is unbeatable for both purposes. It is true that for work in the centre (if you are there on business) and/or sightseeing (if you are on holiday) there is a drive (or train ride!) to do. But part of the beauty of this hotel is that it provides a respite from the madness of the city. Not only is it in the leafy suburb of Bandra (think Mumbai''s version of Notting Hill) but the mile of coastal strip called Bandstand provides a second decompression chamber. Result: you can spend the morning working /sightseeing/shopping etc. in the maximum city and retreat to your sanctuary for the afternoon.…,5,Jan 2014
3655,missippy,"We booked 3 rooms here, deluxe on the 14, 15 and 16th floors, resepctively. Much to our surprise and disapointment, the decor in the rooms was old (circa 1980s), with salmon colored stained and foul smelling carpet, and pink marble tile in the bathrooms. The furniture was also quite old. Very unpleasant, to say the least.  In addition, the service in this hotel was not as good as other 5 star hotels (the porters were slow to offer help getting taxis or carrying luggage, and the laundry service was not timely).  The food from room service was also not very good.  I would not recommend this hotel to anyone.",2,Jan 2014

We got married at this hotel and for the last 5-6 years we have been celebrating our anniversary stay at this hotel. Last year our stay had its share of hiccups. To avoid a repeat I mailed Mr Birgit Z, GM at Taj Lands End. He was quick in his response and assured us of a comfortable stay. True to his words, It turned out to be the best weekend ever.  It all began a day prior to check in. I got a call from Miss Nikita at the front office who enquired if I had any special requirements during our stay. She assured us of a good stay as well.

3657,123four,Taj Lands End has amazed me - I have always booked club level rooms here and on this occasion they upgraded me to a club level suite - it was at the time the best room that I had ever had the pleasure of staying at here.  In January a few days ago I was upgraded (or down graded) to a Executive Suite from a club level room - this room was fantastic and I preferred it better than the Club level suite!  As expected the service from all departments was second to none - my daughters questioned if they were in India when they were in the Hotel - many thanks go to Swati at reception for thinking quick and helping us out with the connected room that I had requested with my daughters rooms a few days ago!,5,Jan 2014

The location of the hotel really helped in driving down to South Mumbai relatively and being in Bandra, Juhu also close by. We had one lunch at their Italian restaurant and the food was really outstanding.  While our mumbai visit was memorable overall, the hotel service left a lot to be desired. What was absolutely shocking was the cleanliness ( or rather the lack of it) of our room with dust existing in a lot of places and not taken care of by housekeeping.

And for nature lovers like me, you'll feel refreshed with a walk on the Bandstand promenade in front of the hotel. The view of the Arabian Sea from the room was great.

Rooms are big, bathrooms are great. The facilties at the hotel are world class. The gym,  the pool and all the restaurants are very good. Staff is exceptional as well. Location in Mumbai is brilliant. South Mumbai is great as well but there is something about Bandra.  If one is visiting for a week I'd certainly suggest spending some time in this part of Mumbai....as well as South Mumbai",4,Nov 2013

The hotel was conveniently located near the major financial center as well as the airport and we were able to avoid the worst of the Mubai traffic.  The hotel property is lovely, very modern, with large spacious rooms.  The lobby and lobby bar are well appointed and great for casual meetings.  The work out facility is large, with large windows with a sea view.  I was told that many of the ""Bollywood"" stars work out at the gym, although I would not know them to confirm.  Tip:  ask for a room with a full sea view.",4,Nov 2013

Great view over the sea and over the bridge. Large and quite rooms, big TV. King size bed in good quality. All lights are controlled over intelligent panels, however they do not include the bathroom lights and the drawer lights - so frequently I had to stay up again and turn off the remaining lights before finally going to sleep.  Food is Indian-style, but very compatible for European visitors, e.g. not too spicy, not too hot. Still you may need water/bread to cool down the flames. The dishes change each day and during the stay there was not much repetition - Very Good. The dessert buffet is just awesome, lot's of good dark…",4,Nov 2013

From the moment I walked in until when I walked out 6 days later there was nothing that I would criticize.  The decor was impressive, the layout and furnishings of the luxury suite that I had was delightful.  It was extremely comfortable and light and bright.  Had a reasonable view over the ocean but, being Mumbai it is not exactly like looking over the Andaman Sea as the water is not a nice blue but quite brown along the coast.  They did have a pleasant swimming pool and grounds.

3709,iMMiJaY,This was our second visit to this hotel. We booked a club room but was gratefully upgraded to a suite room.  We were greeting with garlands and juice and the check-in formalities were done in the comfort of the room.  This room was great and huge with a separate lounge area and comfortable bed.  Kids loved the option of renting DVD's that came with free popcorn.  The club lounge was perfect for afternoon snacks and drinks.  The breakfast was excellent with a good variety of western and eastern food. The only criticism is that the menu stayed the same the entire week so it can get boring.  Will stay there again when visiting Mumbai.  ,5,Nov 2013

The hotel is has a extravagant lobby and offers an exceptional Sunday Brunch albeit very expensive by Indian standards.  Like many Taj hotels around the rooms are small (~33sqm) and have an outdated feeling to them.  The staff / service was a mixed bag, some provided the level expected of a Taj employee, while others delivered low service and then awkwardly demanded a tip.  We also had a bad experience at the spa where I had booked a treatment, and they were going to call my room to confirm in the next hour.

The housekeeping staff and butlers too are amazing and quite prompt.  The pool is a must visit as the waters are warm and maintained at a pleasing 28 degree centigrade as we entered in the evening were pleasantly refreshed to feel the warm waters.

3713,OnehandEconomist,"This should be a great hotel but it's beginning to need a refurb. Remember this is a top end property so the standards to judge it against should be very high. And in the public areas, all is well. But the rooms need some attention - e.g. noisy plumbing, a shower that could do a new head and some more oomph, bathroom mirrors that have turned grey rather than silver and more surround sound noise from other rooms than is strictly necessary. Nothing terrible for more run of the mill hotels but not great for top of the range.

3715,Abdul,I have stayed at this hotel on a number of occassions over the past 3 years. There are many things to like about it. It sits at the waterfront and so almost all rooms have a view of the sea which is always welcome but especially so in Mumbai. The lobby is very grand and service is curteous. The gym is excellent as are the staff there. The breakfast is also excellent - though I noted that certain things seem to have disappeared off the menu. What tends to let the hotel down is the rooms. They are rather tired for a 5-star hotel. Probably time of a face lift. As with all 5-star hotels in Mumbai expect to pay top price at the Taj Lands End.,4,w Nov 2013

You can walk out for a lovely walk on the Bandstand, have local tea there while you stroll. The famed Taj hospitality of course is what makes this place special. I was upgraded to a suite from a club room because I really wanted a better view of the sea! That too free of cost and then with regular follow ups that my stay was comfortable enough.

You can either hire a taxi outside of the hotel (usually around 600 Rps) or have the hotel arrange your transportation but it's higher than normal. The other choice is take tuk tuk to the train station (15mins/50Rps) and take the local train to downtown (30mins/50RPS) No matter which choice you make, be sure to tell the driver NOT to take you to the shop.

But the location is very remote.  You can't really walk down the road for dinner, as there is nothing around the Hotel, being a residential area.  It's also a long way from the City in traffic.  My last night was spoiled by construction work going on above my room.  I got about 1 hour  sleep.  The duty manager kept saying he would stop the work, but he didn't.  After the first complaint, the drilling stopped, but not the hammering.  the second complaint stopped the hammering but not al the other noises.  I gave up............  Not good guys!",4,Oct 2013
3752,Vandana-Arora,"My husband and I returned from a visit to Mumbai where we divided our time between Taj Lands End Bandra and another leading hotel. The legendary Taj hospitality is at its hilt here – a fact we were pleased to note. We stayed on the 25th floor of the hotel and were impressed by the tranquility there despite the hustle and bustle on the lobby. Great place to spot a celebrity or two. The guest relation managers and private butlers facilitate smooth check-in/check-out formalities and stay at the hotel – a welcome relief for tired, jaded travelers. The rooms are contemporary, modern spaces, affording generous glimpses of the sea. Prompt room service, courteous staff, well-informed and the thoroughly attentive Concierge ensured a fabulous stay. Thank you, Taj!",5,Oct 2013

In fact I had visited the hotel very frequently to dine with my clients and other business colleagues in Two restaurants viz. Masala bay and Vista. I stayed in the deluxe room which was facing the sea, lush green garden and swimming pool area. You can also see the Bandra- worli sea link from your hotel room window. I stayed there from 11th June to 13th June. It was raining all day and the view from the room both in morning and evening was breath-taking. My room was quite far away from the lobby area.

The room given to us had Swimming pool view. and it was on 17th floor. very spacious room. Bathroom had a big bath tub. They also allowed us to check out a little late.

Check in to the Taj Lands End, Mumbai. Its always a pleasureable, memorable and unforgettable experience always. I have been staying with them for the last 8 years or so and every vist only makes me more stubborn of my choice of hotel and rooms when it comes to the maximum city.

The size, the space, the decor and the fabulous view of the Worli Sea Link make this a very special experience. As with all things Taj, the executive floor comes with it's privileges. From impeccable service to the happy hour, drinking in the sunset and enjoying the delicious snacks. The gym is buzzing, the breakfast extensive with a lot of local flavors like kheema pao, the walk on the bustling seaside in front of the property has it's own charm.",5,Sep 2013
3765,Musafirnamaa,"Great location and few of the memorable visits earlier made me chose to stay over a weekend.  Plus points 1. Great location- virtually can screen most of the shoreline from Worli end of sea link till Juhu. 2. Fan following and the young enthusiasts to Mannat/Galaxy makes it an interesting spot in Mumbai, and of course it is BANDRA.... 3. Standards of Taj property is otherwise maintained.  Negative 1. Taj club room is supposed to be the exclusive service and it was a big let down to know that they dont have the entire breakfast buffet spread. 2. Not an informative check in, had to enquire few things...... it was expected that services be told at check-in.",4,Sep 2013
3766,TheTravellerNewDelhi,"Taj has always been at the top of mind if anyone were ever to say the word hospitality. And this one was no less, in fact it just added to the long list of pleasant experiences at their various properties. A nice feeling starts to envelop you as soon as one approaches the Hotel since it's right next to the sea and is very close to the Bandra-Worli Sea link. You are greeted bby a huge and open lobby with a very high ceiling besides the warm and hospitable staff eager to attend to all your needs. The check-in process was rather smooth and I was shown the room which had a pleasant surprise.

Club lounge the only disappointment... not as elegant as the rest of the hotel, slow service (45 minutes for a salad). On the flip side, the Breakfast Buffet on the 2nd floor is excellent and service fast. Consideration: determine where you need to be in Mumbai and what time. With ~20 million people, traffic is horrendous and the hotel location is a major consideration. If convenient to your activities, highly recommended.",5,Sep 2013

3769,ostramundo,"Ok, so this Taj is probably unlikly ot be bombed relative to the Oberoi and Taj Palace, so in that sense it feels safer, but you pay for it in location, which is more on the outskirts of town.  Staff was good enough (not especially helpful with restaurants recs, for instance), but value for money was good, and breakfasts were heaven.  Breakfast staff was incredible.  Friendly/professional ... inspires so much hope as they were all young, ambitious people with dreams in their eyes.  Anyhow, that is how a lot of India feels, which is inspiring if you're into that kind of thing.  So this is ""good enough"" especially if on business and conducting most meetings on-site.

You'll often see a sea of fans swarming around Bandstand waiting to catch a glimpse of their favourite stars. Bandstand is also the perfect place for joggers, and enjoying the sea breeze. The tunnel effect at the hotel entrance is refreshing, particularly in the moonsoon. Try and get a room with a view of the Sea Link, it's brilliant and one of the best to wake up to.   Quality of Service: I was highly impressed by the quality of service - top-notch, courteous and caring. They attended to all my needs with a smile.

The rooms are good. Housekeeping is just right. Bathrooms are better than other hotels in its class.  The banquet halls are spacious and well furnished.

The location was great - right at the tip of a small peninsula so there's uninterrupted views of the sea. It's also very close to the many yummy restaurants and funky bars in the happening Bandra area. The facilities were also great, with a lovely pool, a kids play area, and lavishly green gardens and lawns around the pool - great for families with little kiddies. The rooms were also nice, decent-sized with tasteful decor and useful amenities. Loved the large marble bathroom.  But for us, it was the service that set this hotel apart from the five-stars.

3780,R,Particularly enjoyed the spectacular sea view and sea link view from the room. The club room is a welcoming place. The ClunLounge is enjoyable. Service is good.   The pool is a bit limited because of its size and shape. The access to the changing room is camouflaged and needs to be well signed.   The Chinese food was B+. But the Indian food was tops - A +++ ! And the hospitality at the Indian restaurant especially was heart warming.   Enjoyed the sea face walks. The pan wala across the street was a delight - both to talk to and for his supply.   Hadn't heard of the special taxi fare arrangement that the Hotel has with the Union. They charge extra and a fixed amount per plan based on destination. A bit unusual for Mumbai where taxis are ubiquitous .   Overall excellent.   ,5,w Sep 2013

The new Italian restaurant appears to be a super-hit - in-house guests apart, plenty of local visitors show up there... so a reservation is essential.  The breakfast buffet is as lavish as I remember from before - and the live counter services for eggs as well as South Indian food seems to have become more efficient even though the coffee shop was full.

The lobby was as you would expect. Pristine. Staff at the top of their game. A delightful experience and relaxing environment.   I was most disappointed by the room. It was a huge sea-facing room, but the finishes were very outdated. It was in desparate need of a renovation. I was greeted upon arrival by an unflushed toilet and the damp smell of mold in the room. The wet smell of mildew is quite common elsewhere during monsoon, but in the Taj?

The rooms and bathrooms are very luxurious (I was upgraded to a Club room). Breakfast is very large and I can also recommend the dinner buffet restaurant. The two other restaurants were also good, but I liked to have the selection at a more economical price. Location is ideal for business travellers due to the many companies in Bangra. Not ideal for sightseeing as it took about 1 hr to drive to downtown. Very grand reception/main hall and would definitely recommend!",5,Sep 2013
3786,sandeep,I stayed during Eid vacations and thoroughly enjoyed the entire day sitting in the lobby and having lunch at Masala bay.  The hotel is so frequently visited by Bollywood stars that I ended up walking up to a few.  The best moment was to meet Akshaya Kumar along with Dimple kapadia.  Food at Masala bay is good but a little expensive for its quantity. Room service was quick and view of the sea in the night was very relaxing on a clear night.

Till 2011 when they had their gym in 3 rooms, it was bad, but the new gym is absolutely the best amongst all hotels.  Their conference facilities are perfect too.  The club room floors are just fabulous.

After flying for more than 12 hrs, I saw that the bathroom had no bathtub, just a shower and, on top of that, the water was cold.

3812,Brian,"I was working in India for a month and stayed at the Taj Lands End for a month. I was impressed by the professional and friendly experience I had there.  Upon arriving at the hotel I saw that security at the hotel is top notch, there's a large fence, thick motorized bars that rise up from the street to keep out unwanted vehicles, car searches and metal detectors. Needless to say, I felt very safe. The hotel itself is located at the end of a small peninsula near the homes of famous Bollywood actors and this helps make it feel even more private.  Inside, the hotel is modern and beautiful. Large open reception area has a large lounge/bar across from the receptions desks. A multistory glass elevator blends nicely behind the central water fountain. On each floor there are shops,…",5,w Jul 2013
3813,eddiedsa,"Possibly one of the best hotels in the world. Although less famous than the Taj Mahal palace at the other end of Bombay, the Lands End beats it in terms of intimacy and modernity.  Staff are the most helpful Ive experience in any hotel anywhere in the world. In one word, the experience is magical. Have stayed here many times, and the experience always beats already high expectations.",5,Jul 2013
3814,jjtBucks,"This was my third visit to this hotel in the last 12 months. I travel to India on business and have  made a point of staying here during my time in Mumbai. For me this is one of the best hotels I have stayed in around the world. The service is excellent, the facilities are world class (except the internet!) and the food is superb. What makes this (and other Taj hotels in India) a place to come back to is the staff. They cannot do enough for you and if you have any issues, that is resolved in no time. Repeat visitors are really made to feel welcome. The one issue I have had is the internet access; depending on which room you are in, the connection is problamatic. I stayed from the 7th July to the 10th July on the 23rd floor in room 2337 and I just could not get any access to the…",5,Jul 2013

Over the past year I have stayed at Taj Lands End, Trident- BKC and at the Grand Hyatt - Santacruz.  For reviews on the other please look at my other review on the hotels.  Of the three, Taj Lands End was the best. Loved the efficiency, the location, the rooms, the service, the meals and the confrence hall.  - I would certainly recommend the Chinese restaurant over the Indian. - The cafe at the Lobby level has some intresting appetizers to go with drinks. - I was there for a week and tried almost all the dishes at the breakfast menu and could find no fault at all.",5,Jul 2013

What differentiates this group is the consistency of exceptional service irrespective of the hotel you stay/ dine at.  Back to the lands end....checked in in the early morning and we were shown to our room. There were a few minor issues with the room...leaky shower and safe did not work. Reported these on my way out in the morning.

The hotel was perfect in every way and our room was very spacious, with an innovative housekeeper who decorated the bathroom with rose-petals and even folded our clothes. The in-room dining was the finest experience and the personal recommendations by Lata were divine and authentic. The SPA experience was world apart with attentive staff who served us cold water and wet towels in the steam room and were waiting with gowns as soon as you came out.

It is well located with sea views- rooms can feel a bit cramped. Very good Chinese restaurant and coffee shop.Getting into South Bombay(town) is easy as there is a sealink that gets you there soon, the sea facing promenade is great for a walk and look around. All the happening restaurants are 10-15 mins away. Well located.",4,Jul 2013
3825,CoolPraveen,I stayed at Taj Lands End in Mumbai for 2 nights with my family and it is really an amazing place to stay. The intro video on the hotel TV channel about the history of the original Taj hotel in Mumbai was amazing and I like it very much. The rooms were really so nice and so beautiful. The staff so kind and very helpful. The service was very good. The food was awesome. The facilities was so good. We really had a very good time and enjoyed a lot.,5,Jul 2013

Great restaurants and facilities in house, and with everything Bandra has to offer just outside your door.  The Club Rooms are really special as well, and I look forward to going back again!  Special mention for Lalita in guest services - she went out of her way to remember my favorites and sent gluten free cookies with my chai, even when I hadn't asked for it. 5 stars!",5,Jun 2013

I must make special mention of Himesh at the traveldesk and Suvarna in In-room dining, who have made our stay very comfortable.  The location is also very beautiful, with great views from most of the rooms. Band stand is very close by and always buzzing with people. So it is a great option to just walk out and de-stress after a long work day.  Overall a great experience.",5,Jun 2013

A very friendly and efficient host whisked me up to my room and informed me I had been upgraded to a suite. The room was exception and I believe one of the best I have stayed in. The hotel is ideally situated and for me offers better options in terms of location and access that Taj Palace. My only let down is that I just feel the breakfast could be better and also that I couldn't stay longer to enjoy the hotel more. However I will be back soon and look forward to this being my new ""base"" in Mumbai. ",4,w Jun 2013
3833,Mudra_M,"Loved the location. We had a sea-view room. Was really lovely, with the monsoon clouds approaching. The Taj service is always exceptional, and ofcourse the food was great as well.

3837,Jon7709,"The service at this hotel stands out most of all.   You will be pampered to a degree even the Taj in southern Mumbai might take notice of.  Location is by the water in northern suburbs of Mumbai.  Mumbai is not an easy city to visit or navigate given the huge socio-economic chasms that one witnesses but this hotel is a great respite from all that goes on around you.  Regardless of the nature of your visit in Mumbai, you can come stay here and feel you are safe, clean and well taken care of.  It's the only hotel I will stay at if I am in this section of Mumbai.  Also close to airport",5,Jun 2013
3838,MidlandsFlyAbout,"I stayed here recently on business. The rooms and the food are very good, and the staff are delightful. The view from my room, of the Rajiv Gandhi bridge across to Mumbai was impressive. I chose this location, because I was working for 3 days in downtown Mumbai, and being just across the bridge made this place convenient. For that reason, I chose it over hotels closer to the airport, such as the Leela, which are also good. It did turn out to be more convenient than an airport hotel, for downtown. It takes about 10 minutes to get onto the Rajiv Gandhi bridge in the morning, due to hold ups in the immediate vicinity of the hotel. Returning in the evening takes a bit longer, becuase the traffic system onto the bridge is very inefficient leaving the city, and there are more hold-ups…",4,Jun 2013

You have the space but it is a void in an otherwise amazing hotel!",5,w Jun 2013

You receive complimentary cookies, fruits, bottled water and wine as well. I left a tip everyday and they clean the room nicely and leaving flowers for you to enjoy! The room has a big bed and bathroom. The bathroom was probably my favorite. I've always stayed on the 17th floor, but what I've seen the rooms were a lot nicer above the 20th floor.  Their buffet is delicious! They serve a variety of meat for the morning breakfast. I am not much of a meat eater, but for some people who miss bacon would be happy to know they serve that here.

3845,Vinvid,I have treated myself a one night stay here after a busy few days of travelling. Lobby was huge and the place is awesome. Front office guy first took me to the wrong floor and then took me to the assigned room. Room was of good size and the view was magical- It instantly hits on you !  I spend hours just looking out of the window. Bathroom was huge and elegant. I did try its Spa and was of good quality - I dozed off halfway ! Breakfast was not that great but the restaurant was very impressive. I chose to take a taxi from outside the building for my visit to Colaba area and they charge you a fair price. Also visited nearby Bagel Coffee shop in Bandra which has a beautiful setting and some awesome food. Altogether I would rate this as one of my favourite hotel to visit again.,5,May 2013

A car is needed to get anywhere, and it is over the bridge to get into Mumbai proper. Next time I think I may stay at the other Taj just to be closer to things to do. But that is not a complaint, I had a wonderful time here.",4,May 2013

I was in town for 3 days of meetings at the Bandra Kurla Complex, which is not too far away. The new US Embassy in also located in the BKC.   The hotel itself was pretty spectacular.  It really is carved out of a very crowded city that makes the Lands End a little bit of an oasis.  The rooms are very nice and the staff is top notch.   I took the hotel car everywhere and the drivers were very knowledgeable and friendly.  It is a bit of a car ride, well over an hour, if you wanted to go downtown to the India Gate.

They can improve on the bathroom lighting, though.  The restaurant, banquets, gym - top-class! But what really impressed, again, was the quality and attitude of the staff.

I only had 1 issue - A very unpleasant spell kept coming on the entire floor, i.e., 18th floor. The rooms are clean & come with a master control board right next to you bed, from where you can control the entire room - Luxury. what i didnt liked about the room was decor. Very minimal and basic.

Doesn't feel like Mumbai as you are a little detached from the hustle and bustle. (Or chaos of the south)  Bandra is a bit of a happening area so plenty of little bars to visit in the evening.

The Health Club is unusually spacious with good cardio equipment and, of course, a great sea view. The pool is a bit disappointing, though, and I hope the strength training equipment in the gym would be upgraded soon! Otherwise a great hotel, relatively close to the airport.  The food at the coffee shop, Vista, was excellent, and prepared just the way we wanted it. The wine selection is very good too, and you will find a reasonably priced wine to go…",4,w May 2013

The level of service is irreproachable, way above any of the hotel chains I have stayed at, including the Hyatt. I don't know how much they train their staff, but most chains would do well to copy this. Beautiful view from my room, great breakfast food, great food in the Club Lounge. The swimming pool would probably need an update but their gym is one of the best gyms I have ever seen, really compensates. I will definitely be back. An important tip: I recommend using an outside service to rent a car. I have a local guy I use for car rental who charges 1500 Rs a day with driver for the full day.

Good breakfast, good Chinese restaurant (though disappointingly out of soft shell crab the night I went).  Smallish pool area but over Easter very very quite so no problem.  Busier on the weekends possibly spa visitors.  Enjoyed everything I ate/drank by poolside.  Try the paneer tikka Kathi roll scrumptious.  No problems at any time, housekeeping etc all top notch.

You then have a garland placed around your neck. I found it a very nice touch. The hotel is abolutely immaculate - dripping in fine opulence!!! Everyone was so helpful and attentive.

They are beyond welcoming and caring whether it is in the restaurants, the lobby, poolside or in the rooms. We went to Delhi and Agra and while we had an amazing time in both of those places, neither of the hotels we stayed at were a patch on the Taj Lands End.

All the restaurants we visited Vista, Ming Yang, at the spa and poolside, all of them displayed such exceptional and smooth service.

Check in was super quick and the lady took us to the room personally, we got an upgrade too. The hotel didn't ask for any security deposit - small detail, but trust is so much appreciated. Whatever you ask over the phone - you receive in 5-10 minutes.  Obviously there must be some cons :) In-room dining menu was missing but we got it quickly by making a call.

The moment you enter the hotel, you are immediately transported to another world - truely a world of luxury. Being Taj Innercircle Gold member, was lucky to be upgraded to the Club floor which further added to the luxurious experience. Completely blown over by the fabulous experience. The unique thing about this hotel is that each room faces the sea.Can't wait to bring the family next time around.",5,Apr 2013

My husband found it  hard to shave :)  skipped breakfast but room service at 4 am was fantastic! the chill cheese toast made with a sharp cheddar and de seeded red and green chillies was to die for!

3877,eng_lee,My colleague commented that we were really well taken care of and there is an amazing attention to detail at breakfast and when you need help around the hotel. Rooms have good views of the sea and it's a respite from the hustle and bustle of the rest of Mumbai if that is what you seek.  I prefer the modern room design and layout but some might prefer the old rooms' charm and more spacious layout.  It's somewhat more pricey than other Mumbai options not too far from here but worth the difference in price.,5,Apr 2013

The Lands End is the sister hotel to the more famous Raj Palace Hotel next to the Gateway of India in the centre of Mumbai. It it located about 11 Kms from the airport to the south of the city centre. This hotel is excellent in every respect, rooms, location, views and food. We probably had one of the best meals of our trip in the hotels Chinese Restaurant, only rivalled by the buffet breakfast.

He of course pointed out where all the movie stars live on the drive to the hotel. Someone was waiting for me at the foyer and had already checked me in so he escorted me straight to my room which was great I think. All he asked me for was a signature and made it a very hassle free process. The room was nice and big with a view of the sea. The club lounge was also a good place to have a cup of coffee or just sit and relax.  Nothing to complain really about the hotel and I think it met or exceeded every expectation.  The only point would be the location but again if you have meetings in the hotel then it doesnt matter. Just the fact that you come in from the…,5,Apr 2013

My favourite part was the hotel breakfast where a massive range of food was served and the chefs used to regularly do rounds to check everyone was happy and had tried all the delicious food on offer. On days I said I was doing day trips they would prepare me a little takeaway box of cakes which I thought was so nice.  Room was spectacular and overlooking the sea and the area of Bandra. Bandra is away from the main tourist areas so a bit quieter (in Mumbai terms!) but a good neighbourhood to explore with local markets, shops and of course walks along the sea.  Only negative is that WiFi was not free when I stayed.",5,Apr 2013

The hotel is known for its food and glamorous visitors. the Bandra-Worli sea link is literally a stone's throw away. A pretty amazing sight at night over the choppy sea waters. The pool is small by 5 star standards. The place could get crowded and noisy as it attracts its share of conferences and delegations. Definitely not as classy and chic as its Colaba counterpart, The Taj Mahal Intercontinental.",4,Apr 2013

The Taj Lands End is also a beautiful hotel in the Taj group.   As expected from any Taj, this hotel also lived up to and beyond expectations. We travelled together in a large group after a wedding in India and even though so many of us arrived early in the morning, the Taj provided all of us with rooms. Only one couple did not have their room ready yet, but they were temporarily accommodated in another room as well, while their room was being prepared.

However given that we were in an executive suite I question why Internet had fees and wasn't provided as part of this room?  The main failing of this hotel was service. We were repeatedly forgotten. Let me list the service failures: 1. We're vegans and we asked Krasnaya  Khot (Guest Relations Manager)  if there would be something we could eat. She explained that the restaurant that could most cater to us was Marsala Bay - the Indian restaurant and that she could book for us if we liked as it would be busy that night as it was Holi public holiday.

On the other hand, it is like a respite from the hustle and bustle of the city.  There is a nice pool area with a small bar that is quite relaxing.  The buffet breakfast is also extensive and quite good with both continental and Indian options.  The rooms are comfortable and definitely are well built.

Never experienced such a relaxing nature's call during one of those stress filled business trips. Lol. There is not a single point which can be left out without a mark of appreciation. Everything about this property is commendable; except for the approach road.

In general, service is very good except at the coffee shop where I find, as in other Taj hotels, I always seem to have a problem getting coffee. I also don't like the idea of putting little patties of butter on a tiny plate instead of making it available at the bread station. I had to keep asking for more butter. Breads in Taj hotels is usually very good, except for croissants where only the Taj Lands End in Mumbai serve it fresh from the oven.

However if you want a more 'imperial' experience the deluxe rooms are fine with the vintage tv and pink carpets. Thanks to Searock being removed, all floors have a beautiful view of the sea. Try not to take a pool facing room, they tend to be dingy during the day. The breakfast buffet is absolutely lovely. The spread is lavish.

However what I found at the hotel is that service is not consistent. The waiters at the bar were exemplary, but the staff in all three restaurants were continually lacking.  Three times I have stayed at Taj hotels in India (two further reviews to be posted). I think they are overly expensive and the price is only valued in the silver tray service rather than substance.

After passing tight security, you enter a huge, modern lobby, beautifully decorated with water features and spectacular flower arrangements.

The rooms i stayed in were very good, but felt a little dated. Service was excellent, though $10+ per day is a little expensive for wifi (though it did work fine, contrary to other reviews).

3929,Anna,"I have stayed at this hotel a number of times for business. The service is always very good, food excellent and rooms very well maintained. Guests are very well looked after by the staff, which is usually the case at Taj properties. The sea view rooms are definitely worth requesting. Some floors have been refurbished and the bedrooms much more modern, but even the older style bedrooms are very nice. The location is good but due to mumbai's enormous size it is worth checking its' distance from where you will be spending your days as it can take a while to get around at busy times. I will definitely return to this hotel.",5,w Feb 2013

The room and bathroom are quite big. The downside is aging. This hotel needs major renovation.  Stained carpets, CRT TVs are not what I except from a  Taj property. The breakfast was excellent with wide spread. The stay would have been more enjoyable with better room furnishing.",3,w Feb 2013

The service is great. The food (room service and buffet breakfast) is absolutely terrific. The rooms are comfortable.   BUT... It could do with a bit of a revamp, its older than I was expecting - and the rooms reflect that. So I wasn't blown away. Carpets look worn and rooms arent as modern as they should be. Somehow, it leaves you feeling a bit disappointed even though it is a truly fantastic hotel.   I think most of the five stars in Mumbai are from yesteryear - they are iconic landmarks. But if you are hoping to be blown away - and stay in the type of luxury you would once have found in these hotels - then rather find…",5,Feb 2013

The suite was wonderful and the views are breathtaking although I don't know that it is worth paying extra for the Club Level as they are rather sparing with food or drink (in some ways this isn't bad as it doesn't allow for waste).  Definitely worth a stay here!,5,Jan 2013

Housekeeping were quick and always responsive in bringing us extra toiletries, water etc. In room dining was prompt on the occasion we ordered it, and the food was tasty.

3953,JamalShaikh,"This isn't one of the cheapest hotels on the block. But for those who have the resources or option, the Taj Lands End is one of the best five star options in Mumbai. I'd rate it higher than the iconic Taj Mahal Hotel in Colaba because of the larger rooms with newer amenities, and also the location: the center of town is not South Mumbai any more, it's Bandra, where this hotel is located.  I prefer a room facing the sea, and they always remember that. The ones facing the pool and the Sea Link aren't bad either. One tip: the lower floors, 11 and 12, I think, have older furnishings and block TVs. The Club floors (22 and up) are the most luxurious.  While here, do drop by the newly refurbished gym on the second level. It's less than three months old, and is great to work out at.",4,Jan 2013

Right from the security guard who inspects your car/cab at the entry gates, to the person to checks you into your room ...they treat you like royalty. The keema-pao at the Vista is to die for! I never thought I'd say this, but spinach tastes heavenly at Ming Yang. The rooms are comfy and housekeeping staff is top class. All rooms have great views -- the sea and/or the sea link.

Every member of the staff from the door man to the guy who cleans your room is professional and there to please.  The food is regal, the rooms are immaculate, the pool/hot tub are picturesque -- looking directly at the Arabian Sea.  The best part is the value. You can get a room here from as low as $180-220 US. The same type of luxury in the States or even Europe would run you double or possibly triple that price.  I will gladly try to stay here for a night or 2 any time I return to Mumbai.

Trendy, animated with cosmopolitan Mumbakas, upscale but not out of touch, nice cafés and restaurants (trendy and popular). It really has it all. And in Bandra this was an easy pick.

The front desk staff was courteous but I guess they too were over worked and it clearly showed on them..  The location is one big challenge with the hotel and even a short drive to Bandra can be half hour or more...

Easy to walk out of the front of hotel and turn right and walk past the beach.  Staff were welcoming.  Hotel very good, high level of security.  Room great.  WiFi chargeable.  Laundry service.  Taxis available, we were collected from the airport (arrived after midnight), cost of taxi transfer with uniformed driver was 2596 rupees.",5,Dec 2012

Now you know that has to be a great hotel.  The very nice room had black out shades, we put a DND sign on the door and phone and slept until 3 p.m. without a single disturbance.  Nice drinks around the pool at sunset and a great dinner in the Chinese restaurant later.  Truly hospitable people in a lovely setting with all rooms overlooking the Indian Ocean.  It's not downtown, but has its own hip neighborhood and frequently has many Bollywood people hanging around.",5,Dec 2012
3993,betamummy,"The Taj Lands End is nothing short of amazing. The service was out of this world, the beds super comfortable and the heated loo seat was a brilliant. I honestly cannot find a single negative about the hotel.  I stayed here for four nights and from check-in to check-out, all the staff without exception were kind, attentive, polite and helpful.   Some people have commented on how far it is from the city centre but I found it refreshing to be away from Mumbai's mad traffic and constant noise. The Worli Sea Link means that getting to the other side takes half the time it used to so I can't find a reason complain about the location either.   All in all, this is one of the best hotels I have ever stayed in and will definitely be back.",5,Dec 2012

I have been told by hotel staff, a lot of Indian movie stars living around. But for first time visiting the city, it is so far away from the city centre and it is such a down side for my first trip to Mumbai.   Check in was fantastic, my travel agent even organised this little VIP welcome ceremony for me. The staff dressed up in traditional Indian dress welcomed me, checked in have done in my room.

Strong espresso.  Good conference facilities - just got back from the World Brand Congress there and things seemed very well run with the exception of a few leaking AC ducts on day 1 which they had fixed by Day 2. Would I go to spend a holiday there? Probably not.  I prefer their sister hotel - more iconic and better placed (by the Gateway of India).   Would I consider hosting a conference there? Sure.,4,Nov 2012

We stayed in an upper floor with panoramic views of the Arabian Sea ( When we could see through the smog ) We had access to the club lounge where there were drinks and a selection of food. Breakfast at the club lounge was very poor. We chose to have breakfast at the buffet , which had a huge selection including food cooked to order. Service throughout the hotel was excellent. The location of the hotel is such that there is nowhere to walk to. The area of Bandra is a short taxi ride away. I did not find Bandra to be particularly interesting. I would not stay at this location again, although the hotel was luxurious.",4,Nov 2012

What made the experience average was the service which was surprisingly curt.,3,Nov 2012

The staff is very friendly and efficient. Anything you may need gets arrange as you wish. There are 3 restaurants: Indian, Chineese and a international buffet. I tried this last one and the selection is very good ranging from Indian dishes, European Cheese to Pizza. Breakfast is also very good with a very broad selection of food, pastries and anything else you may wish.  NOTE: although generally 30 min drive are sufficient to reach the airport it is strongly recommend to allow for some extra time. Mumbai is always Mumbai...... When I left it took 2 hours and 10 minutes to reach the international airport.",5,Nov 2012

Yes, every other second  they ask if you like food, room, staying, they bow all the time (what doesn't look nice to me at all), but when it comes to real help - they all useless. Starting from the fact they ask several times to give them passports as they lose the copies. When I stayed in Mumbai for the first time I asked them to indicate the best restaurants on the map. Guess what? The man indicated 90% of shops and just some restaurants.

It was the closest hotel to my parents house and to the reception venue so the decision was more practical than researched. Taj has re-branded most of its premium business hotels and resorts as Vivanta and retained the name ""Taj"" only in the luxury ones. This was a Taj but I wondered if it was in the league of its older sibling the Taj Palace at Apollo Bunder. What we received was amazing friendly service, a beautiful chocolate cake on our wedding night (which I still regret not being able to finish) and a room with the most gorgeous view of the Arabian Sea.

The breakfast is extremely good....with a wide spread & quality food.  However, unlike the many Taj hotels I have stayed, the fresh feeling in the rooms was missing. The rooms had a damp like smell, maybe because this is an old property and very close to the sea....and they seemed dated with a dated 21"" CRT TV in the rooms.

Breakfast spread was great, a lot off non guests come especially for that.  Never felt like leaving the Hotel. Great property.",5,Aug 2012

After a long ride from Pune, the Taj Lands End was a welcome place to call home for a few days.  The public spaces and rooms are impeccably appointed with thought put into every detail.  The concierge service was excellent, taking care of all of our needs.  The food in the restaurant was plentiful and delicious.  My only disappointment was having to pay for wi-fi.  In a luxury hotel of this caliber, wi-fi should be a given, not an extra.  But the staff and service was truly top-notch.  We wished we could have stayed longer!",5,Aug 2012

The success of my trip was down to the outstanding service, I received, whilst staying at the Taj Lands End. Every member of staff at this hotel, who I came into contact with, were warm, friendly professional. My stay was due to business, and what better way to unwind after a long day at work than, to soak in a hot bath. After excepting my turn down service from the lovely Pradnyesh, I was kindly poured a beautiful fragrant bath, scattered with rose petals. What girl wouldn't love that??

Sure to be caught in a jam in the last kilometre 7) Lots of rickshaws and taxis available outside hotel, about 15mins to big malls e.g. Phoenix. 8)Hotel in room dining was good. I was not feeling well one night and the person delivering was caring enough to ask whether he could get me some warm milk.

4054,GolfMad,Probably the best hotel in India. Beautifully located looking into the bay. Beautiful sunsets/sunrises from your room. This hotel service shows you why Taj is known as the hotel chain with the best hospitality in the world. Big spacious rooms - lovely bar with live music and three very nice restaurants. Big pool and relaxing area - this hotel has everything. Located in the center of Mumbai with the famous movie stars as neighbors - it is easy to visit both the south of Mumbai and the north like the Elephanta caves from this hotel.

I would have liked ot see wifi included for the price of everything. It is a turnoff for such a basic item to be cost on top of the hundreds/thousands spent a night.  Room 2536 was where I stayed and had a great view of the sea link.. The bed is comfortable and the room is nicely decorated.

The staff is courteous and like to oblige.  However, bear in mind that there is no happening bar, night-club, disco or lounge associated with this facility.  All of this is far from the hotel.  Hence, if you are in Mumbai for business, this is an ideal, quiet plae which will give you ample amount of pampering.

4060,Sanjay_GT,"The experience in Taj Land's End has been absolutely fantastic. Each room offering a sea-view and overlooking the Sea-link, the location is one to die for !   The location of the hotel is something that needs to be spoken about. Almost next to Mannat (SRK's house), it lies in the neighborhood of a host of Bollywood stars. If you are lucky, you are likely to bump onto some Bollywood star (we were lucky to catch Jackie Shroff during dinner and Rekha during the breakfast).   No amount of words are enough for the courteous staff who'd go all out to roll out that extra care for you.   The only area where it could improve is probably the breakfast menu that seemed unchanged during the 4 days we stayed here.",5,Aug 2012

Sea view is a personal thing - Mumbai is locked both sides by a very brown sea and actually not 'pretty' as far as any sort of view goes.  Breakfast was impeccable with massive choice.

The attention to detail is a perfect 10. We had dinner at Vista (the 24 hour restaurant) and I would strongly recommend the butter chicken at Vista to all those who stay at the hotel. Also, the buffet breakfast at Vista has a great spread that you must not miss. That said, if you have never visited Bombay, Bandra is not where you want to stay. You certainly do want to spend a day in Bandra, but you shouldn't make it your base. The base should be south Bombay (downtown). I will end this review by saying that if you must make Bandra your base, then the Lands End is the best hotel you can pick.",4,w Jul 2012

This is one of the best Taj Property frequented by business travellers, professionals, bollywood stars etc. At bandstand, overlooking the arabian stands this great property with immaculate interiors, courteous staff. Last visit was memorable with a free upgrade to the suite and a a bottle of wine to enjoy th eevening. Suite is quite spacious and quite modernly done.

It is tucked into a wealthy neighborhood where many of the Bollywood stars live, and the hotel right by the entrance to the new Sealink highway to south Mumbai so it is a convenient location.

4118,deepakmDelhi,"Taj Lands End seems to reflect the malaise across the group. After a ridiculous experience at a Taj hotel in Chennai, a month or so later I was in this Bombay hotel. The group experience is best described by the word: shallow. I checked in with a prior booking to be told I needed a government identity card. There was no prior intimation of this. Actually I have never been asked for this. I usually stay with the Oberoi group and across their properties I have never been asked for this detail. More likely is that they must have asked once and have maintained a record while I have forgotten, because surely the Taj cant be unique in demanding this detail. The point is I didnt have a government issued identity with me at this instant.  Usually I carry my driving licence but that is…",3,Jun 2012
4119,kn0ck,I stayed in this hotel extensively over a 3 month period.  Staff are very friendly.  The hotel is very expensive and there are small specialities missing that make you feel your not in a 5 star hotel.  The gym is newly renovated and is very nice but far too warm during the day in the heat as the sun hits the windows at the front.  The 3 restaurants are nice but the food is very repetative in each (although as I said I was there for a long period of time so this wouldnt be an issue for short stays).,4,Jun 2012
4120,Mani_Prav,"Second time here, and its everything you expect from a Taj. The service was minimal but very good none the less. The room was very comfortable, clean and well decorated. The Indian restaurant was excellent, but the Ming Yang seemed more like Indian-Chinese rather than Chinese-Chinese. The menu needs a little more Chinese names in it rather than just have ""Chilli chicken"", ""Ginger Chicken"", etc. Living in Hong Kong, i do like a good ""Indian-Chinese"" meal once in a while, and it was good, but i guess being at the Taj, it needs a few changes. But overall, i had a very pleasant stay with no problems at all. Staff was mindful of my busy schedule and did not waste any time with any requests/processes. The lobby bar is very convenient and a nice open space to meet.",4,Jun 2012

I got a pickup in a nice long black car from the airport, but due to traffic took nearly 1.5 hours to reach from the airport. I checked in and thought it would be an upward spiral from there, but it wasnt. When I reached, the room was allright, but the bathroom had been used and still dirty! I promptly called about it, and some body came and cleaned it, but its not what you expect from a 5 star.  Then I ordered for food and the lemonade and club sandwitch were just okay, nothing great. In the morning, the view from the room was great though. The breakfast was also standard 5 star, nothing exceptional.  I think Taj…",3,Jun 2012

It was great being pre-checked in, as I hate that bit of admin as soon as you arrive at a hotel, (passport/credit card out - all that lack of trust) strong security here, but totally polite, bordering on charming. So many great members of staff in the hotel, I loved my room on the business floor (a smoking room!) and the business facilities I used were fine. If you're off to Mumbai on a business trip, stay here, away from the chaos of the city. Loved it, recommended. I will be going back on a non-business trip and would rather stay here than the Taj Palace.",5,May 2012

The most incredible thing was the breakfast. Fresh juices, fruits and many different types of foods....it was really hard to choose what to eat. The location of the hotel is also really nice, it has a wonderful view to the ocean. The only negative thing I can mention is the security checks which can be a bit frustrating, but it is better be cautious.",5,May 2012

The lobby is beautiful and the check in service was very friendly and effective as well. Thanks for the upgrade to the Taj Club. Next time, I will go for a room in the taj club, it worth the extra money. Those rooms are located in the top 4 floors (above the 20th) and each floor has a lounge, where you can enjoy a high tea from 3:30 till 5:30 with sea view, and cocktails drinks from 6:30 till 8:30 PM with some good quality snacks at no extra cost.

The pool is okay - not super sexy but fine...didn't try the poolside bar which is trying to be low key but seems a bit ""down"" and not quite as glamorous and you'd expect.  The rooms are good but I would say that they're on the small side compared to the Hyatt at the Airport.  I stayed on the 24th floor in the Club Room and so I can't imagine what the standard rooms are like - it feels a bit cramped...but manageable.

Coming back to the room close to midnight at the end of a very long day, I was assailed by a stench when I lay down to sleep.  The bed linen and the mattress were both stinking.  Housekeeping came by and appeared apologetic but un-surprised - apparently many of the mattresses in the hotel were old and this was a common problem, so the standard protocol was to change them when someone complained.

One gentleman even took the time to answer questions I had about cricket.  The staff who clean the rooms do so spectacularly.  It's the little things like folding your clothes, placing your glasses on top of a cloth napkin and placing a flower on your bed each night.

The fist was finding that my bathroom had not been cleaned cleaned properly before I had checked in and I did not arrived until 11pm and the second thing was finding that upon checking out I had been charged for car hire that I had not had...this does highlight how important it is to check the biill!!!!,4,Feb 2012

The staff were all extremely helpful and evey morning Ritesh, the Restaurant Manager, would insist I try yet another Indian dish specially prepared then and there. The breakfast choice was amazing, with every nationality and food preference catered for. The room was very spacious with much attention to detail. The marble bathroom was huge with separate bath, shower and enclosed toilet. If possible book a Seaview room - the view from my large window was of the Sealink, South Mumbai skyline and far below the beautiful pool area.",5,Feb 2012

Actually, it is not that far from the business area of Parel.  The service was great --- friendly staff and everything was made easy.  (the staff don't just say yes to make you happy, and they don't look at you blankly) Breakfast in the restaurant is fantastic --- everything you want readily available. Room service --- delivered to the room professionally and with everything you would expect from a 5 star hotel. Pool are was nice to sit by for a few hours. Internet in the rooms worked well.  My only comment is the exorbitant price of drinks, I had a G&T by the pool and it was over $25! (USD), but I guess it is expected.",5,Feb 2012

Lovely pool area and gardens - don't be afraid to walk over to the Bandra Bandstand and fort just outside the hotel gates as well.  I do have to make two comments that are not deal breakers but are worth noting:  the location is definitely not central to anything in Mumbai.  You can easily get a taxi or car service, but something to consider depending on what you want to see/do.

The 1st night of my stay -their frontdesk upgraded me to the Club room without me even asking for it. Guess  my long Innercircle relationship was being honoured there-WOW  I loved the experience so much that I  extended my stay through Monday in the same room .

The gym facilities are great, and often needed after dining at the wonderful Indian restaurant on the first floor. Quite simply, I have eaten some of the best Indian food I have ever had the pleasure to taste at this place. Incredible. The Taj Club, available when staying in any of the club rooms, is superb both in the morning (fantastic breakfasts) adn evenings (relaxing drink or informal meetings).

The beds were a bit firm but acceptable. The whole hotel, especially the rooms, had a musty odor to it, one that is somewhat characteristic of India overall though.

The breakfast buffet was more than sufficient, they had every variety of food including American, English, Chinese and Indian. We were pleased with our experience, except I should point out a few of the drawbacks:  1)  The hotel is located in the quieter part of the city, and as a result most of our taxis did not know how to get there.  We had to stop several times to ask locals for directions.  On the other hand, it was really nice to be in the quieter part of town.  2)  We were initially given a room on the floor directly above the lobby with a ""sea view"".  Our room was…",4,Feb 2012

Bandra-Link road is nearby which has nice line of shops situated on either side of the road. Shopping here can be a real experience!  The name ""Taj Lands End"" serves right because this part of Mumbai (land) ends with this hotel and offers an excellent view of the Arabian Sea. The view of Bandra-Worli-Sea link is awesome. The whole area is somewhat hilly (not hills in the actual sense, because I come from the hills and I know what real hills are like), but tiny you can say and if offers an added beauty to the area.

Only thing is that the hotel is a little outdated so the halls smell a bit musty. A minor inconvenience though.

In our corridor to the room in level 18 there was a bit a smell of paint as they just renewed. But the room itself no smell, all fine.  The security check has become more strict but this is normal and unfortunately necessary in Mumbai. We also booked a  tourist tour via the hotel with a private driver and guide.

The rooms are very modern and the bathroom is full of gadgets. All rooms face the sea which makes it perfect! The pool and gym are fantastic too and all restaurants serve great food. The Sunday brunch at their coffee shop Vista is truly amazing. The Indian restaurant Masala Bay serves the most authentic North Indian food and the kebabs there are to die for.

I've stayed at the Lands End and also the 4 Seasons, which are on either side of the sealink.  While the rooms at the 4 Seasons are bigger, the Taj get's my vote based on the quality of the rooms, service, and location.

The club rooms looked more cramped than the deluxe rooms. The lights were also dim. If you do not care for frills deluxe rooms are also good. While checking out as we were in a wedding i was not to pay but, i verified my bill we were charged Rs.3000 app for mini bar, which we never used, this was surprising and few local call which in mobile age very few people do from the hotel landline. We had to get it reversed. The mini bar bills seems to be mischievous, hotel should investigate.",4, review Dec 2011
4225,Behappy26,"I stayed here for a couple of times for business trip. Overall, the hotel is wonderful with impeccable service. If you can, do stay at club level rooms as the rooms are really different as compared to the ones at normal floor. The club level rooms are newer and nicer. This is the hotel to stay if you work around Bandra area",4,Dec 2011
4226,JoshiMadhu,Many will be surprised with the title of this review but its true the Taj Lands is a romantic business place and this is more to do because I staye din the area for many yrs and recenlty stayed because I no longer live in Mumbai (earlier Bombay) but visit for business.  Bandstand is the area is full of lovers and specially squatting on the rocks at the shores and then the place is full of young people handing around to see the waves breaking through the rocks. The hotel is whatever 5-7 star property and sitting on the Lands End with perfect view and has all the trappings of business hotel for international repute. So be happy and enjoy the food at the coffee shop.  By the way many of the guets maynot know but one can go climb to the ruins next to the hotel i.e turn left from the…,4,Nov 2011

Also go down to the Land's End and see the sea with lots of local people, as it is also a local tourist attraction point. The main restaurant and the coffee shop are great with live music. The sunday brunchs are more than perfect . Stay away from the Indian restaurant , it is pricey and under average.   In addition Shah Ru Khan, a very famous Indian actor'S house is very near with a nice story. When he was young and poor, they were walking with some friends and he said I will buy this house. His friends laughed but at the end he goes rich and buy the exact house he showed. You can see Indian guys getting photos in front of his house when going to the hotel by car.",5,Nov 2011

Maybe it's me, but to go out each day in a city like Mumbai and to come back to a luxurious haven like this was brilliant. The service, the rooms, the facilities were faultless.   Security in India these days is pretty full-on, and the Taj hotels even more so but they carry it out quickly and respectfully which made it easier to tolerate.   Honestly had some of the best Indian food at breakfast buffet. The range of options and the freshness of everything was fantastic, honestly one of the best breakfasts I've every had.

Don't get me wrong it is a wonderful hotel and the staff were first rate (although you always get the impression that they are doing it for a tip rather than because they genuinely want to serve) but this is top wack rates for an average 5* pad. The club level rooms are spacious and well equiped, comfy beds, large TV, DVD player etc. the other floors are somewhat more sparten and are in need of a refit. The pool area is also pleasant when the weather allows and there is a good selection of fine dining - all very nice if you forget the exchange rate and just get on and have a good time.

The rooms there have got renovated and are stunning with every amenity you would expect from a luxury property like this. The service is taj so you don't need to worry about anything generally.  The club room came with a very fancy bathroom with a separate bathtub and a shower.   The room had a great view of the sea as well. The only thing that takes a little getting used to are the light switches. I also missed having a mirror in front while shaving - they instead have side mirrors which look great but I found them irritating. This is a great property to stay in if you have work around the bandra kurla or world area. Great sea…,5,w Nov 2011

We had to resort to flagging down waiters for assistance and refills.  The management needs to seriously improve the Vista dining room.

Must enjoy the breakfast. The lobby was very convenient to meet clients in the evening for drinks. The staff are excellent at the Taj and the food in the Vista buffet restaurant is very good indeed. It just faces the sea and noise level is zero. Excellent hospitality,5,Sep 2011

I was alone in my room.  The staff found me and got me to the nearby hospital in time. I was amazed at their calmness and professionalism.  The hotel manager who accompanied me to the hospital told the hospital to start treatment immediately as they would cover my hospital charges. I was later told that not many did that. Fortunately after a couple of hours, my company took over the hospital charges.  While I stayed in the hospital, my wife came to be with me (from Toronto). She stayed there too.

For all the comments about and reputation of excellent service levels from Taj hotels, I was a bit confused about being led to a smoking room on arrival when I booked a non-smoking room and I was asked for my preference at the reception desk on check-in where I again requested non-smoking. This was fixed up, but it made my check in a longer process than it should have been.

It's apparently located right around the corner to Shah Rukh Kahn, a major India celebrity where paparazzi lurk during the days and nights.

The breakfast buffet was pretty good, with a mix of Indian dishes and an more western--i.e. omelets made to order.  I'd say during my 5 day stay in India in which we stayed at a different hotel every night, it was probably the 2nd best hotel breakfast.

Taj Lands End balances on this fine rope perfectly. The interiors of the room in which I stayed also deserve a mention. It was very classic decor style with wood panelling, very tastefully done. I had the good fortune of my business stay being extended for 2 more days and I relished it.

4344,Suhasini21,"I frequently stay at the Taj Lands End when I travel for work. The hotel has a beautiful ambience and architecture. The view from many of the rooms is breathtaking, overlooking the Arabian Sea and also the Sealink Road.  I find the rooms bright and very clean. Plus they have all the conveniences you would need. If you need something that you want that isn't provided, like an adaptor for your laptop, the staff is extremely prompt in responding.  The restaurants offer excellent fare, and the breakfast buffet is yummy. My only complaint is that I tend to overeat before a full working day. Again the staff is very fast, responsive and polite, taking great care to serve you everything exactly as you would want it.

4345,Aarti,"The Taj Lands End property is at an excellent location if you : a) need to be near the airport b) need to work near bandra, andheri etc I love this hotel. It does not have the character of it's sister property in colaba in the same city, but its better for business travel.  The service is great...if you opt for a pick up at the hotel, they usually alert the reception before your arrival, and your check-in is super smooth.  At the land's end you should definitel try out the dimsums and konjee crispy lamb at their chinese restaurant...and get a table with a view if you are booking for lunch. The Indian restaurant is good, and if you are dining there make sure you ask them to make chapattis live for you at the table...nice...the food is also lighter (made in olive oil apparently)…",4,eview Mar 2011
4346,Sujhz4,"One of the most famous hotels of Mumbai, Taj Lands End is apparently constructed in such a way that every room faces the Arabian Sea. Yes a piece of India's land and a corner of Mumbai ends here on the face of earth. Yet the hotel presents the elegance and its prized and possessed piece of property in a very unique manner. While a typical 5 starrer, this hotel has everything under the sun from brilliant rooms to food to alcohol to just about anything you name, their chapatis came as a surprise to me...They were of the size of pooris and while that amused me, I realised perhaps if the trip is not official, you rather eat out hopping behind the hotel or sip coffees across the beach side... having said so the hotel s beauty is its view and for that boy do they charge a fortune. But…",5,Mar 2011
4347,adikumar,"Tucked away in a corner of Mumbai is Taj Lands end with a beautiful view of the sea from the large & spacious rooms. The hotel is a land mark in Mumbai with a beautiful lobby and the Atrium Lounge. It has a great swimming pool and a fabulous gym.   Though the food in the buffet is nothing that great as it lacks the kind of perfection. More than the food, I guess it is the service at the restaurants which made the food look not that good. However, their chinese food is amazing and a must visit.   It is a nice hotel, though a little away from town one can be sure to catch enough action around it.",3,Mar 2011

The Taj Lands End is pleasant enough, don't be surprised by the increased security at all the hotels, with an excellent view from our room across the Arabian Sea/Indian Ocean.  The hotel itself feels like it needs a bit of an upgrade (much like the whole of Bombay) but provides an element of seclusion from the hustle and bustle of the rest of the city.  Its also a short (if hair raising trip) from the airport.  Has a good spa and a strange pool (beware the creepy crows towards sunset)! My wife used the hair salon for her nails and hair which was good.  Note its on the sea but no beach as such (more a collection of rock pools surrounded by dirty water).  So OK hotel which from the sounds of it is the best…",4,Mar 2011

4357,Sheila,"I agree with the other reviewers on the caring staff. I visited and stayed in other hotels on this trip and Taj Lands End was by far the best for its service and facilities. Because of the bad weather in the UK I had several flights cancelled and was unable to contact the airports, airlines or our travel section.  The hotel offered to send someone to the airport to speak directly with BA as we couldn't get through on the phone.  They could not have done more for me on my extended time and had Christmas not been coming up I would have been in no rush to leave.",5,w Mar 2011
4358,AbracadabraPune,"Amongst the various star hotels, I rank Taj Lands End as one of the finest Business hotels in India. Right from the spacious and modern rooms overlooking the Sea to the quality, variety and spread of the food in their restaurant for all the meals. Buffet is highly recommended with virtually a personalized service right from the time one walks into the hotel to all facents. Infact the hotel has perfected the ""moment of truth"" like what scandinavian airlines did to turn the airline around. A must consideration while in Mumbai",5,Mar 2011

The staff was very efficient and courteous...i have never liked the traditional welcome with tilak (1st thing i do is use the ladies room to wipe it off) and I am only glad they don't have it. The check-in was smooth, however, I would have liked had they spent some more time explaining why they were charging such a huge pre-authorization amount on my card.   The room was fantastic but what takes the cake is the bathroom...you could just slip in the bathtub, sip wine and watch TV. I would have really liked if a few ergonomics were taken care of - like a remote to dim the lights from the comfort of your warm water tub...or the phone nearby. But then, no matter how much i would love it,…",5,Mar 2011

Most rooms look out to the Arabian Sea. Rooms are big and well furnished, but lack sufficient number of electrical outlets to charge gadgets. Smallish pool, but the attached jacuzzi makes it interesting. Overall, the hotel is quite good, but the exterior probably needs a facelift.

The hotel tariff is slightly expensive, However it is really worth it.  We get to see lot of celebrities inside the hotel.    The restaurant on 1st floor is awesome. They serve yummy food.

I was seen by the doctor and a very caring member of staff. I was presribed various antibiotics which were dispensed there and then and then offered coconut water and natural yoghurt. Throughout the next 48 hours, the hotel staff monitored by progress and couldn't do enough for me.

One of the nicest designed rooms I've stayed in in a long time: great furnishings and lots of lovely decorative touches; the shower was especially nice.  The room was packed with thousands of free little extras, from shaving kits to shoe polishing kits to stationery.  Bottles of water were provided free and replenished twice a day.  Service is (almost always) outstanding, with incredibly attentive staff everywhere, who pull off the all-important trick of making it look like they actually care.

You enter the building surrounded by helpful staff, feeling like a celebrity. A fresh fragance of rose water welcomes you to the elegant lobby.  Promising. By then the city caos is left way behind. Checking in begins, and it feels much more personal and professional than in other hotels. Then, to the room. Beautiful, spotless.

On arrival I learned the spa was closed for maintenance- I took a look anyway in case I might want to revisit after opening and was really surprised at how run down it looked- almost to the point where parts looked unhygienic and like an old hospital.

The service was excellent, the rooms large, and the location was good for the Mumbai area with easy transportation either by taxi or autorickshaw. The hotel allowed us to check out late as a courtesy which we appreciated very much.  Perhaps the major drawback with this hotel is the fact that the rooms are showing some wear in the carpet the furnishings.

The Taj Lands End is close to the airport, so I could leave the hotel for those earlybird flights much later than if I had stayed in the city centre. Unexpectedly, I also found that most of my business contacts are now in that part of the city too. Mumbai is such a dispersed and elongated city, being situated around the long bay, that it can take hours to get anywhere. However, the new bridge which is in sight of the hotel cuts the hour's drive dramatically and it is now possible to reach the city centre in 10 minutes.

The best thing about this hotel are the views. Fabulous view of the sea from the rooms overlooking the pool. Its located a little out of the way, but just a little. Only one small problem - the hotel uses the most atrocious lighting, all incandescent; some bulbs are in fact low voltage and turning out a lot of heat that the aircon needs to work overtime to pump out. When I told them about it they put me in their ""green"" room. This one has no fridge and no control panel for the lighting and stuff. One light had a switch so inaccessible that its almost impossible to switch off while looking…",4,Nov 2010

I have stayed here on many occassions and found it very consistent with the service quality. The infrastructure is also very solid with a v. nice and cosy fitness centre and swimming pool area.

The service is excellent in all aspects throughout the hotel. Nice meeting rooms, again with above standard service. All our requests were met with friendliness and instant attention. Several restaurants, all with very good food options. I would say the wines at the bar are not so well kept. I can recommend this hotel to everyone who wants to hold a business meeting in Mumbai, but doesn't want to be in the city centre (this hotel is just North of the centre).",4,Nov 2010
4407,pinhas84,This is one of the finest hotel one can stay in Mumbai. My first choice of stay was to stay in Marine Drive. As the city was quite full I was booked by my office and stayed at The Taj Lands End. The hotel was recently taken over by Taj and renovated. It was earlier run by another name. The rooms are spacious and the view is breathtaking. It has great views of the Arabian Sea. On check in we were upgraded to the club room which enables us to use the lounge and also a late check out. I love the hotel and it will be first choice the next time I travel to Mumbai.,5,Nov 2010

From excellent food delivered by very helpful and freindly staff who could not have done more for me, Oils and salts left for me to have a relaxing bath, an offer to be escorted to one of the restaurants by one of the female menbers of staff so that I did not have to eat alone and security that makes you feel completely safe.

My recent visit was for two nights. I did not find any new changes in this hotel, except a huge increase in the price!! I was very disappointed to see that Taj had made no efforts to give a face lift to this hotel. The rooms have still the same old CRT TV sets, same old furniture etc. This hotel is a very elite location where many famous Bollywood starts, rich and famous live.

Some people mention the lovely views of the sea - don't think of blue lapping waves, the sea is very oily-looking, no beach and a big concrete expanse in front of the hotel where new building work will be starting. This isn't at all a problem when you stay there, just don't expect a ""beach"" hotel. The staff are excellent at the Taj and the food in the Vista buffet restaurant is very good indeed. I hate hotel restaurants as they have the atmosphere of a canteen, but the food made up for it to some extent.

If you require to do business in South Mumbai or a on vacation this is not a convenient location. The traffic at peak periods is horrendous. Although the Sea link has definitely help reduce the time taken to get to South Mumbai. In terms of the hotel the Taj Service is legendary. The service is of a very high standard and the attention to detail is terrific. You are made to feel that you are the only guest in the hotel. Their unrenovated rooms are looking a little tired now although they are spacious. The decor and etc is really in need of an upgrade.

The 20 Km drive from home took 1 hour, thanks to the traffic jam near Lilavati! Finally we landed in the Grand Lobby of the Taj Lands End and then the wonderful surprises started!  1. We were welcome by the Hotel Manager who surprised us with a room upgrade to the Taj Club category.

The staff are attentive to the point of being quite annoying.  The breakfast is dull unless you like Indian food and it is the same everyday. The bacon is fatty and overcooked and you have to get waited on to get coffee - I'd rather get my own.  The mini bar is really expensive. £7 for a bar of chocolate and food generally in the hotel is well over priced.  The business facilities are excellent. Quite frankly not worth the money.,3,Aug 2010

While the breakfast lounge has lot of niches and corners, which provide individual table spaces to work or talk, but the entire space is a bit cramped.   The food was out of the world.

Customer service is excellent as well. I had requested a couple of things on our first night, and when the front staff forgot to keep it, the Manager sent us a complimentary bottle of champagne make up for it. If anyone was ever to stay in this hotel, the Ocean view is the only room I'd recommend.

Unlike the other Taj Hotels in South Mumbai this one feels a bit cut off from the neighbourhood and street life (which frankly is what I love about Mumbai).

It's actually on the 4th floor! They've arbitrarily decided to ""promote"" all their floors by 7. So in reality, one is quite close to the ground floor, street noise and has a horrendous view of an open construction pit next door.   Also, that end of the floor seems to be directly over the nightclub. Both myself and my colleague who was in the room across the hall could hear music at different times in the night.

Found the spa and fitness facilities exceptional.  The pool area was a bit dated, though still a good spot to recover from the 15 hour flight from the US.

From attending to the minutest details to going the extra mile to make a guest feel at home they have it all covered.  But thats just the topping on the ice-cream. The Land End is located at the corner of Bandra a suburb in Mumbai. Over looking the sea on one side, and the new suspension bridge on the other the property affords a mixed view of the city.  Occupying a prime space in the suburban mumbai skyline this property offers not only a great location, but phenomenal service and a great set of restaurants.  From the organic food restaurant to the thai, and chinese restaurants. Each is done up chicly, and is a joy to the palate.  All in all a great place to stay with amazing…",5,Dec 2009

As we were on the way to hotel, a lovely view of Bandstand awaited us and passing by Shahrukh Khan's ""Mannat"" we knew we were near the hotel. The Security at gate screened us and i just thought the same thing everywhere but i was wrong and what awaited us was the lush grand lobby and a different reception counter...where you wished with a Namaste and asked to be seated while your records were pulled out. And everything was smooth and fast.  the room was perfect overlooking the sea and wow...i had the most romantic time of my life. The room was perfect..and before the trip, my wife told me it was too costly but seeing the room, she just…",5,Dec 2009
4539,chrisngpg,"From the outside, and when you step into the room, I must say that it's a very decent and respectable hotel. Very friendly staff too, from the traditional garland welcome to the cheery chambermaids.  However, when you need to replace your keycards once a day because they get erased (doesn't happen to me in other hotels, by the way!) it's not very convenient to keep going up and down 20 floors. Not nice to have rusty water coming out of the pipes too. Ditto to have extremely bad TV reception in the bath. And chipping walls.  If you're like me and you like to wander around, the location isn't superb either cos there's nothing much around the area, unless you want to see Shah Rukh Khan's mansion (actually, all you can see is the 30ft surrounding wall). And the fact that it took…",3,Dec 2009
4540,nycjames,"Mumbai is loud, busy, and messy. One needs a refuge from the bustle to rejuvenite. The Taj Lands End offers that. The rooms are plush and equipped. The staff hovers nearby anxious to help with the smallest of difficulties. There are hundreds of rooms, and the hotel was busy. Yet, when I stepped out of the elevator into the lobby to check out after four days in Mumbai, a manager stepped forward, addressed me by my name, and said that he would alert me when my car arrived. I only visited the bar three times while I was at the Taj. As I stood to leave the staff came forward presented me with a bottle of champagne and stated that they missed me already.",4,Nov 2009

I had a very luxurious room with a king-sized bed, flat-screen TV, glass-enclosed-shower, and huge bath tub.  Since I had to work at night, I appreciated how easy it was to connect to their fast internet server, which is something I didn't expect in India.  Being in the business guests' floor (21/f) also had its perks -- There was a round-the-clock conceirge right outside my room, manned by very warm, helpful staff, and a quaint restaurant/cafe in the same floor where we had a small breakfast meeting one morning.

I started in a Deluxe Room, which wasn't bad - the furnishings were a tad dated but the room was very clean, the staff incredibly courteous and for Rs 10000/night, it seemed like a good deal. Halfway through my stay, I upgraded to a Taj Club Room. WHAT A DIFFERENCE! Totally modern furnishings (felt I was at the Tribeca Grand or the W Los Angeles), for a cheaper rate than NYC or LA - very much a value.   Included in the Taj Club rate was a car to/from the airport (with a very courteous and professional driver - way better than a typical Mumbai cab), and breakfast at Vista every morning. The food at Vista was exceptional - the best buffet breakfast I've experienced at any hotel.   I also tried Masala Bay,…",5,review Nov 2009

In Taj style the lobby and the lobby bar are outstanding. I've always been lucky enough to get a great view of the sea each time I've stayed. But the biggest advantage is that it's in Bandra so it's close to pretty much all my friends, not too far from most of my meeting places and 20 minutes away from the airport.

Rooms very clean and being fortunate to have even tried their suite over the last few years I must say they are all clean and very pleasant.  Being a vegetarian and lover of food I most certainly selected the best hotel.  Buffet at their 24 hours coffee or resturant was delicious and excellent service from manager to the waiters and cooks.  In my opinion they have the best Chinese resturant in town.",5,Jun 2009

Only problem that one may find in the location is the Bandra traffic. On the narrow lanes of Bandra, traffic jams are very frequent and can leave you frustrated.  I stayed here 3 days during my visit and all three days were very comfortable. The food was good as you will find in any of the Taj hotels, hygiene was of top quality and the service extremely good.  Only hotel in Mumbai which I will call better than this one is the Taj Mahal Palace. But then it is also cheaper than the Taj Mahal Palace.

The worst thing is that my room was located below an area of the hotel that was being renovated and some type of alarm went off at 3 or 4 o clock in the morning, and would not stop despite my call to the butler.  The hotel overlooks a decayed building that was blown up some time ago, and this property also needs some demolition of its own!  Over-all a night to remember - for the wrong reasons.

4605,MarkMunich,"The hotel is not located in central (i.e. south) Mumbai (Colaba) but in a good location for business visits. The international airport (Chhatrapati), Bandra Kurla Complex and other business areas are easy to reach and you don't have to stay at a typcial airport hotel. It is not an ""old fashioned"" style (like the Taj Mahal in Colaba district) but much more contemporary/modern. The staff is very friendly and responsive with a good appreciation for business traveller's needs. I had a Club room (similar to Hilton ""Executive"" and others) and this grants access to the Club Lounge with good breakfast and a cocktail time in the afternoon.

The hotel itself is a little bit out of the way - which is good and bad.  Good that you away from the bustle of the city when work's done, bad because it takes extra time to commute.  The hotel is grand and luxurious.  Service is good albeit lacking imagination.  I happened to stay here during the night that the other landmark Taj hotel was terrorized (26/11/08) and I called the front desk a few times to be assured that all was well here.  I was expecting a public announcement of sorts advising residents to stay in their room, etc. but I think the hotel took the necessary security arrangements instead.

I ordered in-room dining the first night I was at the hotel, and they brought up a table to the room that had an oven below it that kept the food nice and piping hot. The waiter laid out the table incl. a lit candle which added a fine touch to an otherwise boring in-room dining experience! It almost seemed as if I was in a classy restaurant rather than in my room. Their understanding of a guest's need showed up once again, the day we were checking out when their Chinese restaurant served us a fine meal in less than 15 min, since we were getting late for our flight.

Check-in is a breeze - they're expecting you and have everything ready - rooms are large and comfortable, and the Vista cafe is consistently good. (I didn't visit the others.)  Service is extremely attentive, which can actually get wearing after a while (I was tempted to disarrange the cakes on display in the restaurant, just to count how many seconds it took for a smartly-uniformed cake-boy to appear and restore them to perfect right angles).

4612,Fleabane,"Taj Lands End is faultless – at least I couldn’t find anything wrong, and that’s saying something as I spend 6 months a year in hotels.  Things could be better for sure – the Ming Yang Szechuan restaurant was eerily unspicy, while the Masal Bay Indian was, well, a little bland, tokenist even. Maybe this was deliberate for a foreign clientele, but which was not in evidence. Don’t get me wrong – both were fine, just lacking in pzazz! A colleague told me Vista was better than both…  Sadly Bandra is not South Mumbai otherwise Lands End would be the most sought-after hotel in town – it is that good!

However, the hotel is above average for a Taj, particularly the club room floors, which have been recently refurbished.  (Note there is still a lot of refurb going on so the day time can be distruptive so get up early).  The main problem is the location.  Ideal for the airport or for visiting surburban Mumbai, but it is at least two hours from downtown Mumbai.  Also the hotel is next to one of the main sewage outlets of an overcrowded city so when this is released into the sea at night and if you happen to be travelling to/from the hotel at the time, the stench is overpowering.

I have been upgraded both times to a Club Room free of charge & find them very comfortable. The hotel restaurants are good & it's a nice place to relax after a busy day in the office.

We stayed at 2 adjacent rooms at the club level, and it was great after a long day of shopping to come back to the hotel and relax.  There was one asian restaurant on the 2nd floor of the hotel that was excellet, we loved every dish.  The hotel is definitely pricey, but from what I experienced, the service was very nice, the rooms are luxurious, and it's very conveniently located near the shopping centers of mumbai.

We've stayed for 8 nights as we needed a short break from home and work and at no point we regret our choice. We've been to Mumbai in 2005 and then stayed at The Taj Tower Palace. But this hotel is much more pleasant. And the food in all of the restaurants is superb, but we liked the food of Masala Bay the most. The Chinese food at Ming Yang is also very good.

Going to churchgate or any of the city center destinations though was a bit of an ordeal. Mumbai's infrastructure is crumbling and rush hour traffic in the morning can make a 3 mile trip take over 2 hours.

They are WELL worth the extra charge. We originally checked into the lower level rooms and they weren't 4-star. They felt 3-star, but Club Level was 4-star or above.  One other challenge with the hotel: The pool is not that relaxing as there are crows that circle overhead all day. It didn't seem to bother some people, but I found it unbearable.  Other than that, The Taj is a great hotel with great restaurants and a nice lobby -- the best part about it is the staff!",5,Jun 2008

I paid over $ 400 per night for a week’s stay, so it does not come cheap. However all other services too were over priced, a hotel taxi to Colaba and back costed a whopping Rs 3500!! Almost a hundred dollars, while a AC Taxi would have costed Rs  800.
